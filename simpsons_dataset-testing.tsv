1	Let's not fight in front of my cool new friend.
2	We're in the middle of the desert...
3	"Listen to me, son. No one loves a quitter. So you go over there and you win her back."
4	"Hey, if I poisoned them, would I be doing this?"
5	We should get out of here. Come on.
6	"Of course not. Why would I want to look at a nude woman I'm not even married to? I mean, I wouldn't even know how she could improve me."
7	Have a good time at your hippie club.
8	That raccoon stole my lamb chop.
9	Put it away. Put it away!
10	"Homie, what are you thinking?"
11	I was just trying to learn the--
12	What the--? Half goes to Bart. Half goes to my Vegas wife. What's left for Moe?
13	Now Ralph is in this play with me. I just know he's going to embarrass me in front of the whole school.
14	"Hey Marge, I just thought of something."
15	"If you ever come near Homer again, I'll strangle you with your own hair extensions. That's right, I know."
16	Yabba... dabba... dooooo...
17	Send in reinforcements!
18	"Bart, what are you doing up here? Everybody's worried."
19	"Are we gonna die, son?"
20	There ya... Just second...
21	"Um, yes, I'd like to host an A.A. meeting. Tonight, if possible."
22	I have nothing to offer you but my love.
23	"Thanks, Mags. I could use a pick-me-up."
24	"I lost the rest investing in a Broadway musical based on the real life story of Eddie Gaedel, the midget who had one big league at-bat."
25	"Ah, quit your belly-aching, ya big loser!"
26	"So, can I deliver that to the office for you?"
27	That means you're terrible!
28	It's almost lunch time. Do you know where your brother is tutoring?
29	You play right field.
30	Church songs with clapping... I don't think this is what Martin Presbyluther had in mind when he founded our religion by sticking his Three Suggestions under the Pope's windshield wiper.
31	"Son, we all have to do things we don't want to. Like have jobs and families and responsibilities, and having to be Mr. Funny all the time -- You think I wouldn't rather be living nude in the forest? Like some ancient pagan! Just dancing around playing the pan flute! And here we are!"
32	Yeah. Well that's always been like that.
33	"Ooo, still plenty of parking."
34	Kids... How would you... like to go to... Blockoland?!!
35	"If that woman thinks she's been scorned now, she ain't seen nothing yet..."
36	"Don't worry about a thing, honey. I'm gonna help you through this."
37	"Heydilly-ho! Welcome to your new home, neglect-areenos!"
38	Your mission is to find the fireworks smugglers and get them to say something incriminating on this tape.
39	"Well, I paid for this ticket. That makes me an adult. I'm going."
40	We'll take your word for it.
41	You're the only smile I got.
42	"Oh, Homie, you couldn't keep up a hunger strike. You eat while you brush your teeth. You're eating a huge sausage right now."
43	Well surely you agree we can do without her.
44	Lis! No! It's prime-time!
45	"For your information, Gloria, my ""wassail"" is just Gatorade I put in the microwave!"
46	"Oh my God, Homer! They're right next door!"
47	"Boo hoo hoo, you can cry all night. It's not gonna win me back."
48	They become your slaves...
49	It's about time. We've been making small talk about Mussolini for fifteen minutes.
50	Wait! Stop! I know bullets can be scary sometimes. But I have an idea. First we pull off all of your fur.
51	Looks like we're down to our last ten bucks Hello.
52	Yeah. Getting back to my grade...
53	"Oh, thank you, thank you!"
54	"Hey, hey. So... how 'bout those TV dinners, huh? I try one the other day. Lightning strikes -- the peach cobbler goes out."
55	"Dad? It says ""Non-Toxic."""
56	"Wow, you've signed up quite a few people, Dad: Sea Captain, Bumblebee Man, Comic Book Guy, the Squeaky Voiced Teen..."
57	"Hey man, cool crash. Way to cheat death."
58	"Anchorman, huh? Well, if I'm gonna be an anchorman, I'd better go bleach the crud off my teeth. I'll be in makeup."
59	"Try to focus on something else. Umm... You like Jimi Hendrix, right?"
60	Pumps are shoes! That explains a lot.
61	How about getting out of the tank... huh maybe stopping your rampage? Huh? We could go to Krusty Burger...
62	"Now, uh, everyone follow me to my chair, where I just need to get off my feet for a few minutes."
63	"Look, buddy, I don't care where you go, but you can't sleep here."
64	You should have called. I was very worried.
65	"Marge, she's gonna narc on our stash."
66	"Why -- oh, I give up."
67	"Ooh, you're both way overdue for a spurt."
68	Oh my God... space aliens! Don't eat me! I have a wife and kids! Eat them!
69	"Where do you think you're going, Missy?"
70	"Ooh, that's tough, pal. But it's never going to happen to me."
71	"No, I think the expression is ""peg."""
72	She likes you! Put in a good word for grape.
73	"I'll see you later, honey."
74	"Hey, it's gotta be good if Satan put his name on it."
75	"They're just words, Neddie. Words can't hurt ya."
76	"Gentlemen, for our road trip, I have taken the liberty of preparing an airtight and utterly plausible alibi for use on our parents..."
77	What will become of our kids?
78	Because... I... I called it off.
79	"Kids, kids, you're both right."
80	"Eh, I've had a good run."
81	I heard about your run-in with Hoover. Aren't teachers the worst?
82	"In Doggie Heaven, there's mountains of bones and they can't turn around without sniffing another dog's butt! And all the best dogs are there. Old Yeller... and about eight Lassies and..."
83	Maybe I am. But you can't argue with the laughs.
84	No! I can't get in trouble if I can't see you.
85	"What's the matter, scared you might like it?"
86	"I'm sorry, but I love Homer."
87	"Hmmm. And, Bart is set for the week."
88	"Okay, Dad, they've got our flag guarded pretty good..."
89	Are you sure they're not talking about cars? Because those are car words.
90	And then we got him neutered.
91	"Don't worry son, we have ways of making him compliant."
92	You know I hate surprises!
93	"Well then, I guess the moral is, ""No good deed goes unrewarded."""
94	Or the way Dad used to call the radio station with fake traffic tips?
95	"Okay, we got a litterbug on F-6... double homicide in progress on Q-22-- a woman sunbathing topless on R-15!"
96	"Hello, I'm Marge Simpson and this is my husband, Homer."
97	"Then, with your last ounce of strength, you pointed to W and S. Waylon Smithers."
98	I guess my honky-tonkin' days are over.
99	LISA IT'S YOUR BIRTHDAY / HAPPY BIRTHDAY LISA / LISA IT'S YOUR BIRTHDAY / HAPPY BIRTHDAY LISA...
100	"Okay, let's see... ""The price of stamps will climb ever higher."""
101	"You want me to join Mensa? Oh, that's wonderful. But don't I have to take some sort of I.Q. test?"
102	I can reach the poisons now! Each with an inviting skull and crossbones.
103	"Yeah, never mind how I look. You gonna give me the money or not?"
104	"First, I want you to hurl a ball at the nearest authority figure."
105	"But I'm out of the woods now, right? I mean, whatever doesn't kill me can only make me stronger."
106	"I guess fate was against us. It's really nobody's fault. Right? Uh, right?"
107	"No, this is about you. Edna wants to break up."
108	"They're gonna win the championship, no thanks to me."
109	"Western, huh? Did you ever see my ""Wyatt Burp"" sketch? Everyone on my payroll says it's great."
110	"Did you have a nightmare, Homie?"
111	"Oh, that must be the babysitter."
112	Have fun getting coffee for Roy Disney the Third.
113	"Hey, Dad, how come you've never taken us to see a soccer game?"
114	And I'm good at beginnings.
115	We're both in the same reading group. I think you know how smart I am.
116	"Marge, do we really need all these feminine products?"
117	I really appreciate you helping me find Homer.
118	But you've got me. Who have I got?
119	"Homer, this is our house."
120	All right. Just this once you can take a drink out of my special water bottle.
121	"Smithers, where does that tube go?"
122	"Hey, Foamy, I want the news, not the weather. Marge, did you hear me zing Werewolf Flanders?"
123	And the soles of your feet are jet black.
124	This just became a treehouse of horrors!
125	"Now I've had my head in an elephant, a hippo and a giant sloth."
126	I'd love to look at SculleryWeek -- if you're through with it.
127	What are you dopes lookin' at? You've never seen bling-bling before?
128	"Simpson, eh? How very strange. His job description clearly specifies an illiterate."
129	I mean... you know if we wanted to... not that I... ever did.
130	All right. I suppose my work here is done.
131	"Now remember, pack only necessities."
132	Oh my God! You won the pot? You must have nearly a million dollars! I can go to college and live like a Kennedy.
133	"Hey, I'm innocent, man!"
134	She's heading for Prairie Dog Village!
135	"You saved me, Reverend. You really went above and beyond. Thank you!"
136	"Now Marge, ""Dear Abby"" says seeing films about air travel can calm your fears. Ooh, here are some upbeat titles. ""Hero."" ""Fearless."" ""Alive."""
137	"Homer, you're physically an adult, and what you do in the privacy of your own soul is your business. But I didn't change Bart's diapers for five years to see him become a Catholic."
138	"So, how are you, Mrs. Krabappel?"
139	Dad? You got me a skateboard?
140	"I'm saying goodbye to everything I ever loved. Ooh, a marshmallow!"
141	Whoops -- didn't time that quite right.
142	"Well, you are not going to any concert that promulgates stink talk."
143	"There's ""Tipsy""! And there's ""Queasy""!"
144	"Well, they're both lovely."
145	"Sir, I must remind you that the dedication of the Burns Wing of the museum is only six days away."
146	"Last entry. I have mountaineered to the utmost, but the peak is unclimbable. Worse still, that treacherous skunk Abe Simpson stole my oxygen, and tried to eat my left arm."
147	"Thank you, Mr. Bergstrom."
148	On vacation he digs wells in Darfur!
149	You should've thought of that before you dropped out of the DeVry Institute.
150	"I don't know, but she's my new hero."
151	Not perfect?! You can say that again.
152	And you'll never baby-sit again!
153	"As you know, we've inherited quite a budget crunch from President Trump. How bad is it, Secretary Van Houten?"
154	"C'mon Barney, if you're gonna be General Grant, you have to have a drink."
155	"Free 'n' easy, Lis. Ahh. There's nothing like an unfurnished basement for pure comfort."
156	"Get ready for exciting quarter mile action at the Springfield Dragstrip. It'll be motorized mayhem !... Do we need all these ""mayhems?"" We do. All right, fair enough. I suppose you know your business. Get ready for fun ... The people are already here. We don't need to keep hustling them like this, do we? Hey, let go of me! Where are you throwing me?"
157	"Well, it's been two long trips, but we're finally almost there, again."
158	"You always save me, trombone elephant."
159	Sit on a bench! Sit on a bench!
160	"Everything I know tells me this story doesn't end with us sitting here, and you telling it to us."
161	"As long as two people love each other, I don't think God cares whether they both have the same hoo-hoo or ha-ha."
162	"I'm sure she'd be proud that her descendants had piping hot tap water and plenty of warm, dry underwear."
163	Uh-oh. That might have broken the phone. I'd better call Moe.
164	Perhaps you're wondering why you have two heads? Well my body was crushed so I had my head grafted on to or shall we say ample frame.
165	"Mom, I swear on your eventual grave I will never, ever, let the police get their hands on you. Uh-oh."
166	"Hey, what about military school? It set my brother straight. Now he owns and operates a famous cave."
167	The life jacket is under the seat.
168	"Oh, yes. That greedy, grasping, glob of chemicals."
169	"Hi, Moe. Where's that waitress of yours?"
170	"I think it's time to go ""off family."""
171	"Oh, uh, well, he wanted to be here, but I'm gonna decrease the volume of my voice and mumble so you can't really understand what I'm saying..."
172	Look a little closer.
173	Food Dad! Food Dad! Food Dad!
174	"It's three hundred, Mom."
175	Eduardo. I haven't felt this good in years. You're like the Tooth Fairy except you don't collect human bones.
176	I'm a horrible mother.
177	"Wow, being in show business is like a dream. We're really lucky, aren't we?"
178	"This way to the scene of the crime, men. I've got her tied up in the den."
179	"Wow, what an ending? Who'd have thought Darth Vader was Luke Skywalker's father."
180	"Wait a minute, they're gonna kill Dad!"
181	"Yeah, but this town doesn't deserve me. I'm giving this badge to the next guy I see."
182	Moldy!?! Old!?!... I'm gonna get something to eat!
183	"I will not suffer your insubordination! There has been a shocking decline in the quality and quantity of your toadying, Waylon, and you will fall into line. Now."
184	Why don't you put a personal ad on the internet? That's how young people date these days.
185	"No. No. No. No. My God, what passes for a wine list these days. Marco, just bring us your freshest bottle of wine. Chop. Chop."
186	Did you spend our savings on a motor home?
187	"Uh-uh. My wife's lookin' for a bathing suit that doesn't make her look ""horsey"". So, I'm gonna be here a while."
188	Don't play dumb with me. We found your book.
189	Aren't you smart. Let's try another one... A little harder this time.
190	"Well, maybe not, but I have the gift of being able to see inner beauty."
191	"It's been a rough patch, man. Hope you got something to cheer me up."
192	"I mean, if I should slip something into your pocket, what's the harm?"
193	"Eww, I hate that icky soup skin."
194	"Hey, is that a camera in the ceiling?"
195	I can finally win a gold medal. I came close at the 1936 Olympics...
196	I could sure use that flying motorcycle now.
197	Wait! You promised to take me to the museum!
198	Homer! Gimme back my tree!
199	I'm so glad you two are friends again.
200	"Certainly, Lenford. Make every day a celebration of your love. Surprise her with a pasta salad! Put a mini-beret on your wang!"
201	"Every year at this time I show what's probably my most requested clip. Roll it, Freddie!"
202	"Aw come on, gravity. You used to be cool!"
203	You can't hurt what's already dead.
204	And the last team to arrive will be fired.
205	"Homer, I want you to show this woman the time of her life."
206	"Don't worry. I've got a plan. Okay, Ned, the first thing we have to do is..."
207	"They're not dolls, they're aspiration figures. But it might work."
208	Comin' at ya live from the Civil Defense Shack in the remote Alkali Flats of the Springfield Badlands!
209	Flanders?! How'd you get in here? This place is a highly-sensitive area.
210	"You didn't join a band to become famous like in ""Almost Famous."" You loved playing music with your friends. That was enough to make you happy."
211	DE-FENSE! DE-FENSE! DE-FENSE!
212	"Hey, what's that dealy?"
213	Why do you have to eat peanuts in the shower?
214	Anyone testing positive for narcotics will be terminated immediately!
215	"Hello, Marge. Sorry I didn't call but it's been a madhouse down here... Yeah, these twelve hour days are killin' me."
216	"Ow-ow, stupid-trash, rotten-stinky, hate-world, revenge-soon, take out on everyone... Garbage water! Oh-ho-ho!"
217	And a new record time! Wait a second...
218	"Just send me back to Earth, and put off this whole Rapture hoop-de-do for another couple of years or so."
219	"There's one thing I still don't understand. When Bart went through the transporter, what happened to his head?"
220	Can I have some ice cream? I finished my pizza.
221	I sought shelter in a nearby tent.
222	The cooling tank just blew and they're taking Lenny to the hospital.
223	"Get out of the way! How come he's not ducking? Ugh! Wait a minute, I can't get my... Get out of the way, stupid!"
224	What the hell could that mean to you?
225	"Yeah, beg me, Bart. Beg me!"
226	"Oh yeah? The tornado was more of a father to me than you! Okay, how about my brother? He's rich."
227	"Wow. I'm free! Get ready, world! I've got a whole new set of mistakes to make!"
228	"People learn from their mistakes and your father made so many mistakes. And now, Patty and Selma are here to help us decorate with their new love-bots."
229	It's the name of the freezer!
230	Go take some wildlife pictures or something.
231	"DUMB DAD SORRY FOR HIS BET. Wow, it's almost as if Dad planted that message. No, it must just be a weird coincidence...but what if it's not? Oh, it must be...or mustn't it not?"
232	Don't leave until you find that leak!
233	Call me... Abraham Simpson!
234	"Uh, you remember we did that once before?"
235	"And according to my gut, you're okay too."
236	It's a cow's heart. They're trying to make a monkey outta you!
237	"Help me! Help me, Lord!"
238	Hey! Hey! Quit pushin'! I was here first! Get out of my way!
239	"Where did you get the idea for this, Mom?"
240	I'll call work and tell them he can't make it.
241	Forget I said anything!
242	"Well, if there's one thing I don't like being taught, it's a lesson. I'm so mad. Not only will I endorse Ted Nugent...but I will call for an end to the direct election of senators."
243	The place where the waiters sing.
244	Bets don't talk. They see and raise.
245	"Ooh, ooh! Can I cuff him?!"
246	"Oh, now Martin's scoring off of me. Oh, that is it. Listen up, everybody! Follow me!"
247	The Antonin Scalia bedroom!
248	"No, you do. You're gay for Moleman!"
249	"Of course. We wouldn't think of going without the bait... uh, that is, the bait-thing beauty -- The bathing beauty. I covered that up pretty well."
250	You almost killed me!
251	"No, I'm gonna go backstage and complain. This Krusty Brand alarm clock sprays acid in your face."
252	Every eligible bachelor in Europe wanted her hand in marriage.
253	Looks like our lifetime ban just expired.
254	"So I figure I should just try to live right, and worship you in my own way."
255	Lousy big shot. Thinks he's so big 'cause he's got a lot of guns.
256	I think you might feel better if you looked at these exit polls.
257	"Electric guitars in church? Oh, my gosh. Some dropouts must have overpowered the Reverend!"
258	Outta my way! She's gonna blow!
259	"And we've got to change our approach to immigration. I have a progressive proposal to let into this country, two hundred grimy Irishmen a year. I've got lots of potatoes that need peeling and stables to be mucked out."
260	"I knew it. Slowing down already, huh?"
261	That's all I wanted: a tiny bit of control.
262	I'm sorry. But I know God would never ask a mother to sacrifice her child for the good of the world... again.
263	I'm not driving forty-five minutes a day! You can't go to that school!
264	"I need to call Janey, but I can't get a dial tone."
265	"No-ho-ho, it's true! Maude and I sell religious hook rugs over the Internet."
266	"Grampa, that's the commissioner of football!"
267	Which one of you is the mailman?
268	"Happy, happy New Year!"
269	I'D LIKE TO TRY MOST EVERY GUY / FROM HERE TO TIMBUK-TEE
270	AND THEIR DAMP-TROUSERED PA.
271	That's ridiculous. No one's bowl smells... it's like Christmas in Aspen.
272	Then go back to Jimbo and show him every boob you've got.
273	"Well, the fiend who did this to my boy is my boss. And besides, the doctor says it's just a bump on the head and a broken toe. Nothing serious."
274	Wow. How many Pulitzer Prizes winners can do that?
275	Shut up and wreck something.
276	"I told you, officer. I'm not ""hepped up"" on ""goof balls."""
277	"But, isn't that a sin?"
278	What's that coming out of the safe?
279	"Yeah, Mom. I need something great. Milhouse has footage of himself falling down the stairs."
280	In my day women didn't make a sound!
281	Anyone? Anyone at all?
282	I just wanted... I just wanted... Come on guys. I'm not doing the spotlight bit.
283	"Enough talk. Dip me, my love."
284	Help! My macaroni Marconi!
285	Fine! You can have your key back!
286	I'm going out for some air.
287	"She's a little weird, but let's give her a chance."
288	"Next stop, the Knoxville World's Fair and its fabulous Sunsphere!"
289	"Hello, Young man Burns."
290	Then that's not the real Ned Flanders.
291	"You like sweets, kids? I know a place that's sweeter than sweetness itself. In this sweet place, earthly donuts are sour as poison. You'd spit them out! You would! I'm talking about the Candy Industry Trade Show. ."
292	"Permission to speak frankly, sir."
293	"Smell any drugs, Sgt. Scraps?"
294	Just kidding. Here you go.
295	How do you cope with it?
296	"Not so fast. This case was already cracked...by the last person you'd expect -- the Chief of Police! You really thought you could fool me with that Burns and Smithers getup? I mean, I'm not the sharpest pencil in the pencil thing, but I'm at least as smart as a cat. Right, Lou?"
297	Next song. / That's what I meant. / Absolutely.
298	"Hey, this really works."
299	"The power of friendship is so amazing, I don't feel at all suspicious of Carl."
300	"Besides, I like some of the noises you make in bed."
301	"Wow Moe, you've been doing a lot of sleuthing."
302	"Mel Gibson is just a guy, Marge. No different than me or Lenny."
303	"Oh, I'd like to apply for a job. Any job. If you don't have a captain, I could be that."
304	"Looks like it's time for Plan B. One, two, three, ""B""!"
305	Even the Pope couldn't forgive this pizza... and he's letting a lot of things slide these days.
306	I am at work. This is what I do.
307	"Why, a woman invented liquid paper."
308	Ooh...a sextet of ale.
309	"That's okay, Bart. Nobody really believed it. We were just trying to scare you."
310	"Homie, get in the car."
311	"Hey, why didn't you tell me the new issue of ""Weird"" was here?! I love their hilarious send-ups of hit movies."
312	But how are we supposed to get it?
313	"Oh God, my back! Suckers! My discs are grinding! Easy money!"
314	"No talking! No new crap! ""Takin' Care of Business!"" Now!"
315	Fine. But do you know how ridiculous you look right now?
316	"Balderdash. This is the silliest load of... Ooh, look at it fly. Whee! Look at me, Smithers, I feel practically superduperfragicaliexpiala-dohhhh!"
317	"Mr. Burns, I came here because my brother is about to be wrongfully convicted. And the man I'm looking for would help me find the truth."
318	I still feel guilty. Your father's not going to be around forever.
319	Something smells fishy.
320	"Our forgotten veterans. Their guns are quiet now. Their helmets lost, or pawned. And yet here they are, making flags out of old clothes. Sure, they may not have the right number of stripes, and the colors are all wrong, and some purists will tell you the American flag doesn't contain the word, ""Jordache."" But you know, if they run this up the flagpole, I'll salute. I'm Bart Simpson."
321	"But... isn't it? I mean, confidence building can't replace real learning!"
322	"Wow! That was great! Can I have my regular clothes back, please?"
323	My mother explained that what happened at the party wasn't your fault.
324	"Oh can't you see this man isn't a hero! He's annoying. He's very, very annoying!"
325	"Oh, come on, I've seen you cry a million times. You cry when you scrape your knee. You cry when they're out of chocolate milk. You cry when you're doing long division and you have a remainder left over."
326	Everybody in the kitchen! We're having a family meeting!
327	My old pen pal from Spain. Eduardo.
328	"So, Lis, ready for your trip?"
329	"Gentlemen, I am inspired to create a theater for the people -- an experience free of all the nuisances and gouging of modern day movie-going!"
330	"Don't be scared, you can do it!"
331	"Well, it wasn't me. It was Bart who..."
332	"So you lost my car, eh? Well, that's just grand. I ought to punch you in the nose, but I have to pick up my kids at school."
333	"...but perhaps Earth's greatest achievement is moon rocks. Oh, and the golden age of radio."
334	Lisa! What are you doing in the Nutmeg State?
335	"C'mon, dad. It doesn't take a genius to realize that Houston's failed to cover their last ten outings on away turf, the week after scoring more than three touchdowns in a conference game."
336	"Don't worry, I'll straighten things out with Coach Clay. We're good buddies. We play this game called ""who can punch the softest?"" And he always lets me win!"
337	"Hey Dad, can I do a ham-bone solo?"
338	Angry Dad got an Oscar nomination?!
339	Welcome to Sprawl*Mart! Can I get you a cart or a basket?
340	"Okay, that didn't work. This time move your head and don't follow through."
341	"I'm a little worried. This part of the county is unincorporated. Just to be safe I'm going to dial ""nine-one"" on my cell phone."
342	"And didn't the Easter bunny himself say ""forgive them, father, for finding all my eggs?"" And if a giant rabbit can lay chocolate eggs, maybe you and Edna can find a way to make it work."
343	"You don't have the guts, little man!"
344	What have you done with my report?
345	"Oh, that's so lovely. But it's too late to win us back with sweet talk!"
346	Really? What are they growing?
347	I don't want a drug boat.
348	"When you go to the polls tomorrow, please -- vote ""NO"" on Proposition 24!"
349	"K-I/S-S-M-Y/A-S-S spells ""kiss my ass""!"
350	Oh who am I kidding? I couldn't enjoy calorie one without my family. I'm going back to save them.
351	Wow. Um... I started an organic compost pile at home.
352	"...saw everything you did! Milhouse is the hero! Take it from me, the boy who's lied throughout!"
353	Which is our room again...
354	"A field goal? Hm... Nineteen, twenty, twenty-one... That would win the game!"
355	"Okay, then you can take Lisa to Dr. Hibbert's."
356	"Oh, I can't believe that till I see a fictional TV program espousing your point of view."
357	"Hey, watch the movie."
358	Whoa! Get him off! Get him off!
359	"Forget it Bart -- it's so bright out, you can't see anything in the sky except the Fox satellite."
360	That place sucks! The nurses don't let Grampa do anything. They practically chew his food for him.
361	By which I meant bring Martin's butterfly project to completion.
362	"Ah, nertz to that! Homer I fed you and clothed you till you were thirteen! If that's not a father, I don't know what is! I'll be waiting for your apology on the ""old man"" bench at the mall!"
363	"Hey, I've been safari-in' since before you were born."
364	IF YOU TRY TO RUN / YOU'LL GET A HEART ATTACK...
365	"And to think, I respected you! And defended you! You wouldn't even be alive if it wasn't for me!"
366	My pacemaker... it's stuck on hummingbird!
367	Bart Simpson got a teacher pregnant!
368	"Well, um, yeah. I guess they'd probably want to be with their families or something, huh?"
369	Six miles and I'm all smiles!
370	Wait a minute. This ain't no genius copter. This is con air!
371	"All done! I swept the aisles and put all the collection plates in the dishwasher. Oh, and you wouldn't believe how many dead pigeons there were in the organ."
372	"Gosh, fifty thousand dollars? I'm donating this whole check to ""Bibles for Belgians."""
373	And they've already started exploiting the next holiday.
374	Mm-hm. What about clay? You got any problem with clay?
375	"So, this is basically what we can afford."
376	"Oh, they've found a home."
377	"Mmm... I love chenille, don't you?"
378	"Well, Diane, I've sure enjoyed chatting with you about your problems with your mother."
379	"Hmmm, Lisa needs to go to the museum tomorrow, and I think you should take her."
380	"That's right, sucker! It's Valentine's Day, and I've got a date with some fastballs!"
381	"But basically, Krabappel said you'd give the teachers everything they want."
382	"Yeah, they'll do that."
383	I'll bring you home my dessert.
384	"Geez, what happened to you, Wiggum? You look terrible."
385	"It's like an ox, only it has a hump and a dewlap. Hump and dew-lap. Hump and dew-lap."
386	That's a lot of places.
387	"Bart, I don't care what Mom said. I think you should use this money to take her on a nice vacation."
388	Bart! Stop being confident.
389	"Oh, I'd give anything to go to that show!"
390	Sometimes you gotta go where everybody knows your name.
391	"Not Flanders. Anybody, but Flanders."
392	I can't go back to living on the surface world! I can't!
393	I really like the vest.
394	"They didn't have my size shirt, but you get the idea."
395	"Hey, leave my daughter alone! C'mon, humans! We've wiped out entire species before. We can do it again!"
396	"Hey, man, don't bad-mouth the head."
397	I guess I could do that.
398	"Larry, there's only one sure way to make him realize how much he loves you. And that... is a phony kidnapping."
399	It's your fault I'm old!
400	"All right, time for a family meeting!"
401	"Oh, I have a funny feeling we will. Wherever people are mistreated, the Pie Man will strike!"
402	Will you remember this the next
403	"I don't know. After living like a billionaire, this place is kind of a dump."
404	"That was two firemen, a crane and Snow White."
405	TV Town! Hammock Land!
406	"Please, Homer. Why do I always have to be the bad guy?"
407	The heat is off. The hissing from the radiator is a snake.
408	I don't like sausage.
409	And it looks like one of the lights in your sneakers is out.
410	Are you doing an app behind my back?
411	"C'mon, boy After 'em."
412	I don't know. I don't think it's important.
413	"Wait a minute. If I hadn't written that nasty letter, we wouldn't have gotten anything!"
414	Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Quit it. Ow! Quit it.
415	"That's quite a tale, Grampa."
416	Will you two shut up? I'm missing precious VJ prattle.
417	"Mmm. Smell them sausages, Lou!"
418	"I'm not a sniveling toad, am I?"
419	"What's wrong, Bart? You love youth culture!"
420	Absotively posilutely.
421	How come it's not open yet?
422	End the song! End it right here!
423	Yay! I won your stupid bathroom products race!
424	"Mmm-mm. Oh, I can feel the pounds just melting off."
425	"Oh, no! The witch has Bart!"
426	Abe? Are you feeling all right?
427	How am I ever gonna take on all those guys?
428	Really? Well I do have a warm sense of well-being and I seem to be ssslurring my shpeech... you're right! Give me another.
429	"Uh, that's where we put everyone's coats."
430	Not my fault! Act of God! Act of God!
431	"Hey, Bartle- eeboobely, care for a steak-a-rooney?"
432	That cost eighty-eight dollars!
433	"Too late, Marge. I already used a ""prayer block"" on your prayer."
434	Awesome! I'll get the white wine.
435	There might be one in this cooler.
436	I want to confess. I killed and robbed the old lady all by myself. Marge is completely innocent. The only thing she's guilty of is loving too much the murder I did.
437	"Uh, excuse me, Reverend, but I'm here to talk about something a little more important: hope."
438	But I don't want that.
439	Do I hear the sound of butting in? It's gotta be little Lisa Simpson -- Springfield's answer to a question no one asked!
440	Correction. Kill us both.
441	Everything was goin' great at first. I felt like I was king of the world.
442	Woo hoo! Liberals! Woo hoo! Liberals! Woo hoo! Liberals! Woo hoo! Liberals!
443	"Son, if this lands on thirty-six, I'll..."
444	"Ooh, I smell barbecue!"
445	"Homer, whatever they've got you on, cut the dose."
446	Why couldn't I be eaten by a giraffe? That would be fun!
447	"Well, last year you got a little rambunctious and mooned the poor umpire."
448	"Ahhh, another beautiful day in the womb. La-la-la-la--la-... ...la-la-la... la-la-la..."
449	"But this isn't like a loan application or a will -- you signed away my dignity. And I'm going to get it back. Lisa, do I have my pants on?"
450	Five... six... seven... eight...
451	Can I have one! Can I?
452	And what's that smell?
453	And you are the greatest thing that's ever happened to me.
454	"Oh, you're not the jerk, I am. Forgive me? Oh, like you're Miss Perfect! Mom! Lisa's making me feel bad!"
455	"Ah, sweet soft-hearted Marge. You just can't see the big picture. If I stick to my guns, the boy could wind up Chief Justice of the Supreme Court. If I fail, the best he could do is judge at a ""Mister Tight Buns"" competition. I can't let that happen, I won't let that happen and I can't let that happen."
456	"Now, ere's what makes art valuable: 1. Nudity. 2. Holograms. 3. Something terrible happening to Jesus."
457	I've got to save him!
458	"Ooo! Swab, swab, swab--"
459	"Oh, look! A shooting star!"
460	I hate the beanbag store. The clerks are always shouting in Hebrew on their cell phones.
461	"Better go fish 'im out, Lou."
462	"Hey, get out, I'm in here! Oh."
463	"Ugh... oh... umph... Oh, Smithers, guide me in."
464	"Hey, what's the big deal? It's just some new guy moving in!"
465	"Oh yeah, let's see where that goes."
466	Take the boy! His soul is fresher!
467	"Yeah. Let's go home, honey."
468	"Shake it! Now, roll over on your tummy, just like I taught you."
469	"Yes, yes, hello. Now, I need to find a patsy."
470	"We didn't have a lot of money, but we were young and in love."
471	"Bart, your soul is the only part of you that lasts forever. For five dollars, Milhouse could own you for a zillion years."
472	"So long, Lisa. If anything goes wrong, just dial 9-1-1. Unless it's an emergency."
473	Three hundred fifty dollars.
474	"Hmm. I bet this place sells illegal fireworks. Just go in and act casual, like you buy 'em all the time."
475	"Show's over, let's go!"
476	"God created the devil? Finally, He did something cool."
477	"So if you wore a Hawaiian shirt, it wouldn't be gay?"
478	"During the war, Eleanor Roosevelt was the voice of Scratchy."
479	"How're you doin', Mr. Assange?"
480	"Actually, we have to go twenty-two hundred miles in ten hours."
481	"Uh, would it be all right if I kept this portrait? To remind me of better times?"
482	"Mom, I admire everything you do--"
483	"Thanks for helping us out, Reverend. I know you've never performed a Hindu ceremony..."
484	"But Mom, I want to hear the witty banter of sophisticated adults."
485	"Yep. You're gonna make it, Dad. And somewhere up there, I bet Red is saying thanks."
486	Super Fun Happy Slide!
487	Thanks. Listen... could you do me one more favor?
488	And now to peruse the local news!
489	"Hi, Dad. Want me to cut out this infernal racket?"
490	I-uh. I think the boy's hurt!
491	"Oh Homer, you promised me..."
492	"Lisa, those maps were drawn by the first explorers of this theme park, hundreds of years ago. Let's go."
493	"Hey, look. Those frogs are eating all their crops."
494	"No, sweetheart, you stay here because--"
495	I'll tell you what's wrong. That rotten Moe is getting rich off a recipe i gave him!
496	Why didn't I stop with the snake wine? Why did I drink the fish wine?
497	"Oh, you poor man. You're about to get a lot poorer."
498	"Bart Simpson, age three."
499	"Hey, tough times, eh? I've lived through twelve recessions, eight panics, and five years of McKinley-nomics. I'll survive this!"
500	"There's ""Dan Rather"" and ""Tom Brokaw"", hanging out with Kent Brockman!"
501	"Lisa, marriage is a beautiful thing. But it's also a constant battle for moral superiority. So I can't apologize."
502	The toilet recommended a place called AmericaTown.
503	"Bart, I'm starting to think you're right. Krusty was framed. Did he have any enemies?"
504	"Lis, you have to release that water. It's the only way to short out the fan."
505	"Well, while you're grading so generously... here's mine."
506	Does it make you feel superior to tear down people's dreams?
507	But where will I bask?
508	How long was he in there?
509	"I did, until we came here last year."
510	"Well, get used to it, 'cause I'm gonna stay."
511	Come to Homer's BBBQ. The Extra B is for BYOBB.
512	And you only wanted those as bait to catch gummy fish.
513	Just like the dead clown promised.
514	"Without the talking stick, we don't hear you."
515	"If it helps, I made you a card."
516	"I told you, the only dancing I like is ""square."""
517	Oh who am I kidding? There's no way I'm ever gonna beat Allison!
518	"Well, if I were a member, we could use my rumpus room as our lair."
519	These are so easy. It's obviously Tom Hanks.
520	I'll start with Radio Shack.
521	"Ray, you know me better than anyone. How can I get my wife to love me again?"
522	"Dr. Swanson, I'm Bart's mother. I've been saving this money for my husband's breast reduction surgery. But I think this is more important. Would you please see Bart again?"
523	"Loyal stonecutters, let us begin our reenactment of the Battle of Gettysburg."
524	You can't blame them for having a social conscience.
525	"You're outta here, drug-o."
526	"Oh, well, this is... um... the, uh... the Listen Lady!"
527	"I know, I know. But I assure you, the police do not take prisoners out of their cells and race them. Any more."
528	Roadrunners are real!
529	Hey everyone. I sure got a lot of attention for winning this year's Race Around the School.
530	You're about to launch a terrible evil on the world. You've gotta destroy this plant.
531	You said you meant to make brownies. Any other lies?
532	"Hey, everybody. I'm home."
533	"Oh well, there'll be plenty of time for explanations later. Right now, I'll be taking my puppies back."
534	One hundred and one thousand!
535	Just takin' care of business.
536	That's the book I need. You'll probably take forever with it too.
537	"That's enough! Next: there's a problem with the reactor, what do you do?"
538	"He's still in need, we have to let him stay. It's what Dr. King would want us to do."
539	"According to the map, this house is owned by the dog from ""Frasier."" And that's where Ellen DeGeneres and Anne Heche live."
540	"Oh great, here it comes -- all the boring things you've done since the last time you didn't kill us."
541	But you wear that little spoon around your neck.
542	What are you talking about? Is there something you know about Virgil that you haven't told us?
543	Uh-oh. I don't like the sound of that.
544	And getting the termites out of the trees.
545	"Pfft, Supreme Court. What have they done for us lately?"
546	"No, no! You're the first successful business I've ever run!"
547	"Hey, Chalmers, where are you from?"
548	I've been selected to represent the school at the National Grammar Rodeo at the Sheraton Hotel in Canada.
549	"Bart, I'll bet you think nothin's gonna top that cactus. Well, check out my present!"
550	"Chief Wiggum, we're just like you policemen. Don't you ever feel like the mayor doesn't care about you?"
551	Oh yeah. I got in your gang and you barely know who I am.
552	"I'm not licked yet. I can entertain myself. No matter how good a movie is, it can't compare to the imagination of a small boy."
553	I think I know who Homer Simpson is. In ten short years you've caused seventeen meltdowns! One is too many!
554	"Oh, that's it. I'm putting an end to this."
555	"See you later, kids. Ah've got to go rehearse with Ned."
556	I thought your car was really cool.
557	And I'm gonna help you.
558	"How about Jon Stewart? He's a son, a lover and a pundit rolled into one sexy package."
559	"Shut up, brain! I got friends now. I don't need you anymore. Duh, yeah, I'd love to go to your house."
560	Wow! Look at all these toilets. And just inches from your bed. Talk about luxury.
561	"There must be some mistake. We, uh, we make cookies here. Mr. Burns' old fashioned, good time, extra chewy..."
562	And don't make that face at me.
563	"Okay, you found out I'm an over-achieving bookworm. So whatever mean prank you're pulling, just finish it up and send me a Polaroid. I'm going to sleep."
564	"I'm so glad you could all come. I'll be reading to you from ""The Origin of Species"" by Charles Darwin."
565	"So this is what it feels like, when doves cry..."
566	"You've started smoking, Dad?"
567	"Dad, what's the point of this story?"
568	"That's it! Ralph, you're a genius!"
569	What if she tastes the booze?
570	"What a deep, tormented soul..."
571	Surely no robot can replace me!
572	"Hey, look. Isn't that Woody Allen?"
573	Oh my! I had no idea how much this town loved that zirconia.
574	Then we're agreed. There'll be trouble.
575	"Go crazy, dorks. I got better things to do."
576	"Sir, of all the books and movies about Teddy Roosevelt, which would you say is the most informative?"
577	"My goodness, what a lovely suit, Sheriff. Is that seersucker?"
578	"Oh, now, calm down Neddilly-diddily-diddily-diddily-diddily... They did their best... Shoddily-iddily-iddily-diddily... Gotta be nice... hostility-ilitity-bility-dility -- Aw, hell, diddly-ding-dong-crap! Can't you morons do anything right?!!"
579	"Son, I'm a bit of an expert on the female gender, and I can tell you: women don't mean anything by anything."
580	"That never happened, Dad."
581	Why? I'm so much happier here.
582	"Yeah, you guys don't want me there."
583	"No. Actually, we came over because I want you to meet my grandson, Bart."
584	"Oh, Marge, but we've needed a new air conditioner for years! And our stopgap solution is getting cranky."
585	Was that Tobey Maguire?
586	"Aw, c'mon, man. Admit it -- you knew this day would come."
587	I did it! I reached him!
588	I don't believe this! Everyone's got an earring!
589	"Come on, loosen up. This is paradise."
590	"Well, I'll be all right as long as I can remember my Army training... Dang."
591	"One... two... Hey, what's the big idea?"
592	"Okay, no more fooling around. Paw, this is Bart. I wish for the Simpsons to be rich and famous."
593	Your team needs you! C'mon!!!
594	You got nothing! You got nothing!
595	"But I was chosen by the Great Spirit to teach these young braves the ways of the antelope and the ear of corn... which we call maize... that the papoose... eh, I'll be at Moe's talking normal."
596	"Nice and hot-o, Mr. Robot-o!"
597	"Hey, leave my dad alone. Just because he's overweight doesn't mean he's bad. He's a sweet man and he has real feelings."
598	"An F?! Okay, this is the time when I always wake up."
599	I hope this typeface catches people's eye. It sure didn't move our old fondue set!
600	Our nature hikes have become grim death marches.
601	"Well, before our dad signs any contracts, he has a surprise for you..."
602	"Why certainly son, just hand me that book you've got there..."
603	Yeah. And to make things even more suspenseful... our plane leaves in a half hour!
604	Like a woman who's made the biggest mistake of her life.
605	"Probably one of Bart's dirty friends! Boy, why are your friends so dirty?"
606	"So, you're gonna flush it?"
607	"Well, since I don't have the remote, I can just get up and change the channel."
608	"Thanks for dinner, Mom. I love you."
609	"Dad, that's Mac Tonight."
610	"That's nice work, Bob. Now give him the rhino tranks."
611	Skinner? He works for me now.
612	What the hell is an Epoxy fight?!
613	"Oh Marge, this is brilliant."
614	True love super-date.
615	I'm cataloguing the violence in these cartoons. I don't think adults have ever actually sat down and watched them before.
616	"Oh, Homie. Don't let it get you down. So Mr. Burns doesn't take you seriously? Big whoop! Who gives a doodle? Whoopie ding dong doo!"
617	Right. And how do I join? Do I whale on some Unitarians?
618	"They're picking me, Dad!"
619	"Awww, look, Maggie wants to fly too."
620	Perhaps there's a non-violent way to silence this girl.
621	"Not sure what you're going for, but"
622	...and that lasted about five years. But then Godzilla dropped out for a while to do movies. All of the awful movies we see now today in the drive-ins that no longer exist.
623	"Homer, you're going to be famous!"
624	So hungry... There's gotta be some food left. Sulfur jerky... Cream of toast... Where did we get all this crap?
625	"Wait a minute... Mom's ashes stopped that missile launch. Mom! You used me to pull one more stupid hippie protest, didn't you!?"
626	But we know so little about them.
627	"Yes, well, just get it right or you'll all be back doing ""Come Blow your Horn"" at the Westport Dinner Theater!"
628	Somehow I missed that phase.
629	"Uh, Mom, why don't you let me call the game."
630	"You can't sex fire me, I sex quit!"
631	"From now on, I'll be doing the thinking for both of us."
632	"C'mon, where's that butter?"
633	"...Well, I... I think I may be coveting my own wife..."
634	"Okay, now to see if I can apply my book knowledge to the real world."
635	"Tip one, ""Live each day like it was your last."""
636	"...the wipers wipe backwards, and the defroster lines on the back window are too close together! Excuse me."
637	I don't know. How long do horses live?
638	And bless your humble home.
639	"But, I'll miss ""Sheriff Lobo."""
640	"Marge, I'm gonna miss you so much. And it's not just the sex... it's also the food preparation... your skill with stains of all kinds. But mostly, I'll miss how lucky you make me feel each and every morning."
641	"Yeah, hold on there, Santa Claus. That box is for toys only."
642	What about the rest of us?
643	But whose body is it?
644	Your grandfather is not a monster.
645	How dare you show my daughter a life of fun and possibility?
646	"Well... Newsweek magazine did say it's good to change careers, right after they laid off all their editors."
647	I spent forty years as a night watchman at a cranberry silo.
648	"Fine, I'll help you with your stupid flash cards."
649	Contagious? Outrageous!
650	It's better to just fit in with the crowd.
651	"Not so fast, Fritz! Before you waltz off with my Grampa grease, I wanna know, what did you do during the war?"
652	Jasper Beardley! You'll never make it!
653	"Homer, I don't think we have the same musical tastes."
654	No! No! Just kill me now!
655	I got Radioactive Man's new villain -- the Collider.
656	"It's beautiful, man! It's beautiful!"
657	I only eat the clown heads.
658	"Stop it, you two! This is Thanksgiving! So glue friendly, or I'll take your glue away and then no one will have any glue to glue with!"
659	My baby boy is in jail! I'm the worst mom in the world.
660	"No, Lisa, don't go upstairs. You'll be trapped!"
661	Did you just unlock the car from here?
662	"Okay, but it's tough for me not to think about their hardship."
663	"Eh, tough crowd. So what's in the news? Oh, right. The bus disaster. Very sad. Now our first award is for biggest people pleaser. You can walk all over these doormats. And the nominees are Ned Flanders...Principal Seymour Skinner... and Mother Theresa Jr."
664	"C'mon, Homer. I'm insisting on a fisting."
665	Take this check for two hundred thousand dollars to the Springfield Hospital.
666	Jimbo drew a couple of pictures of his house in second grade. But I can't vouch for their accuracy -- the teacher gave him a frowny-face.
667	I guess it doesn't matter. All these things cost money and we just don't have it. Unless...
668	So you're saying we're definitely gonna win? -- Woo hoo! I won't need this any more!
669	Wait. All that was in the recipe?
670	"Uh-oh, I'm feelin' a lotta cooties down there. We may need to replace a tooth."
671	The kind that help our Olympic athletes reach new peaks of excellence?
672	"You're not going to eat too much, and we're not going to stay too late."
673	"Look Mom, it feels really weird having you on my turf. How would you feel if I started moppin' the floor?"
674	"That's not a pan, it's a colander!"
675	Beware the Ides of March.
676	"Ah, c'mon, Homer, there's lasers. You like lasers."
677	Hi sweetie. I'm off to Moe's. Love ya.
678	Wait a minute. Bart -- you know that guy on your lunch box?
679	Stop yer snickering! I spent three years on that terlet!
680	"Uh, to work in your power plant?"
681	"Why you, listen to me you..."
682	"Well, you could get some ice cream, or...spend a week at performing arts camp!"
683	You want an alien? This is your alien!
684	"Hey, that's my lucky red hat sitting on top of a double-corrugated, eight-fold, fourteen-gauge box."
685	"Hey, guys. Is it normal to see Burns' face on a bowling ball?"
686	"Mom, did you sleep well at your sisters'?"
687	"You're not gonna let it go, are you?"
688	And Melvin's son brings a banjo. And he works our names into his songs!
689	The first female speaker of the state assembly...
690	I filled the balls with a funnel.
691	Have you nerds forgotten everything I taught you? This calls for a prank. I see a bucket...
692	"Yeah, Homer. Room for one more."
693	You've got to get him out of there!
694	"Dad, I think he's an ivory dealer. His boots are ivory, his hat is ivory, and I'm pretty sure that check is ivory."
695	"Well, my wife's passing was rough, but I think I'm finally ready to move on."
696	I left a half-eaten apple outside your store... the greatest tribute of all.
697	Boring? Is there anything boring about a bad-ass rocker who lived fast and died young?
698	"That's nice work, Lou. Lock 'im up."
699	Three Ribwiches please. And instead of a shake I'd like a blended Ribwich.
700	"If we put charges on the load-bearing walls, we can blow up detention hall while leaving the art room unharmed."
701	"Well, I really think we need to replace the washer and dryer."
702	I said they were thrill-crazed drug seekers. Don't put words in my mouth!
703	"With nowhere else to turn, we went to see the school psychologist..."
704	Please stop eating that. God's gonna furious.
705	What do you do Tuesdays and Thursdays after school?
706	Maarge... come to bed Marge...
707	"You can't throw me out! I'm not dead yet! That's the deal, man!"
708	Why are there so many burnt-out ones?
709	"Marge, your back is so sweaty. I'm starting to slip off."
710	Are you guys working?
711	That's it. I can't live in a house with this prehistoric carnivore. I am out of here.
712	Sing it like you mean it!
713	"May I be excused, Mom?"
714	"Mom, did you have to fly out through all those boogers?"
715	"Sure, if it'll give you peace of mind. But I'm not gonna die for many, many years."
716	"Aw, Mom... This'll take your mind off them."
717	"Faster, Simpson! Those jack-booted G-men won't be far behind."
718	"You know, I have a son about your age."
719	"Mr. Brockman, I need your help. I've got to become a great anchor so I can show up my sister."
720	I thought that Civil War would never end. Now to soothe my head with an evening at Ford's Theater.
721	"Oh honey, do you really think you're pregnant?"
722	"Oh, I don't know, honey. I've got a lot of therapy left."
723	"Well, are you better than me?"
724	How about CompuGlobal HyperMegaNet?
725	"One, two, three, cry! One, two, three, cry!"
726	"Some day you'll thank me for all this scary love! But now, I've gotta go somewhere and do some serious thinking."
727	Is that a good siren? Am I approved?
728	Forget it! I'd look pretty stupid in this outfit walkin' around fightin' oysters!
729	"We will crush you and smother your dreams. Yours in Christ, the Cavalry Kids."
730	Oh! Oh! Why you-- Hey you-- You better-- I'm gonna-- If you k--
731	"...And then he raked me across the chest. And the weirdest thing was, it was that school janitor who mysteriously disappeared -- Groundskeeper Willie."
732	"Y'know -- I think Bart might have too much homework. If they keep overwhelming him, he might be turned off school forever."
733	"We mean it, don't move."
734	I've said it before and I'll say it again: Hell in a handbasket. I hope they find the punk who did this and I hope they cut his head off.
735	"No, no, Marge. It's gonna be very classy, a tea-and-crumpets kind of thing."
736	"You seem to have had, and lost, a lot of jobs."
737	"Yeah, delicious corn."
738	"Welcome to ""The Others."""
739	Lisa's window is the next one!
740	You read my mind. Sooo...
741	Private plane crashes.
742	SWEET HOME ALABAMA...
743	"Oh, this game could mean big things for me, Marge. If I beat Mr. Burns, I mean really wallop him bad... I'm sure to get that big raise I've been gunning for."
744	"It is? 'Ey every-ody, 'eck out I 'ompliment!"
745	"This round's on me, Moe. I got a big payday comin'."
746	"Aw, those poor badgers are soaked."
747	Nobody! You're just gonna break into everyone's house and steal their favorite toy.
748	"You, president? This is the greatest country in the world. We got a whole system set up to keep people like you from ever becomin' president. Quitcher daydreamin', melonhead."
749	What are you talkin' about?
750	I RECOMMEND / OUR DEAR OLD FRIEND / BARTENDER MOE SZYSLAK!
751	"And while I'm in the hospital, you'll have to visit me every day. And then I'll have to come live with you while I recover."
752	Flanders? Kill me? You never killed anybody... and you're gonna start with the big dog?
753	"I get it, I get it! Sucks to be you. Goodnight."
754	"Uh, hold on a minute. Let me have a look at that wheelbarrow, please."
755	"But Homer, tonight's our reception for Queen Beatrice of the Netherlands."
756	Unless you can give me a reason not to?
757	"Hi, everybody. Is everybody... good?"
758	"Hot Thai soup! Ohhh, Bart... ""Dear Lisa. You rock! Mom is calling rescue agencies. Dad is building a giant ladder, but it is of poor quality. We miss you, Bart."" Awww."
759	"Great news, Marge -- we're goin' home."
760	"I don't care about my grade. I'm gonna send Moe's poem to ""American Poetry Perspectives."""
761	I'll let you punch me!
762	"I can't back out, because if I fight him tomorrow...it'll be a less-violent world for you kids in the future."
763	Stupid automatic door.
764	Thank you so much for saving our son from that murderous mob.
765	And I'd like to thank Lester for reuniting me with my estranged wife.
766	Stop your trendy arguing! I'm trying to call the fire department!
767	"So, did you tell Mom you got beat up?"
768	"Shut up, you waste of skin and fat! You've desecrated my every possession!"
769	Whoo ooo! I stand corrected. A million bucks is A-okay!
770	So you and Mom aren't married? Does that mean I'm a bastard?
771	"My Funny Family, take one."
772	Thanks for stickin' up for me.
773	"...so, I cooked the meat, sliced it up, made sandwiches, cut off the crusts, fed those to the dog..."
774	"Beautiful. Eddie, did you trace the phone number?"
775	"Oh well, you'd be surprised."
776	"Shhh. It's coming up, son, it's coming up."
777	"C'mon, Lis, Krusty doesn't want our attention anymore. Let's go worship somebody who has the guts to be a celebrity."
778	"And if you have enough room, add some exclamation points and a pirate flag."
779	I MAY BE THE NEW GIRL / BUT YOU CAN'T BRAINWASH ME / JUST OSH-KOSH-B'GOSH ME / AND THEN LEAVE ME BE /
780	You told me it was up to me if I wanted to go!
781	Did you hear about the blonde who couldn't make ice? She lost the recipe!
782	"Thank you, Ping-pong."
783	Glad I could be of help...
784	"Oh, Marge. Of course Homer's alive. He's alive in all our hearts."
785	"Homer, could you at least turn the camera off?"
786	"I'm watching Sideshow Bob. You know, he's a lot less patronizing than Krusty used to be."
787	It's approaching the podium!
788	"Okay, Marge, you hide in the abandoned amusement park."
789	"Hey... ""Just because we don't understand electricity, doesn't mean we can't enjoy its benefits."""
790	I guess it was a pretty funny prank. I like the ones where nothing catches on fire.
791	"What the--? Ooh, it's hopeless."
792	"You know, that's exactly what I --"
793	"Ooh, you're a scarlet tanager. You've been flying south, because you're migrating to... Machu Picchu, Peru!"
794	We can always get more shoes! MoveMoveMove!
795	"So that's it. The costume's buried now. As my son would say, I'm one sad ape-like dude."
796	Should we inform the Chief?
797	I'm with you all the way. But first...
798	Hmf. The monkey's on my part of the sofa.
799	"Compared to the rest of these people, yeah."
800	"Put a sock in it, preppy. How much are these free burgers gonna cost me?"
801	But Mom had to spend all the Christmas money having it surgically removed.
802	Bart's so well-behaved now... maybe you and I could have a night out!
803	You know Homer Simpson?
804	"Lisa, don't feel bad. Judas betrayed Jesus but he still got paid."
805	Not me when I hit the dance floor!
806	Stay there! I'll come down and save you!
807	"Homer, I'm as permissive as the next parent. I mean, just yesterday, I let Todd buy some Red Hots with a cartoon devil on the box. But you can't possibly think it's appropriate for your ten-year-old son to work in a burlesque house!"
808	"I'm sorry, honey. I just thought you..."
809	I would strongly support that measure.
810	Check. Did you unscrew all the flat heads?
811	"Well, why didn't you say so?"
812	"Ew, I can't watch this."
813	"You know, Bart, if we combined your showmanship with my integrity, we could make kids really care about the news."
814	CALL MR. PLOW / THAT'S MY NAME / THAT NAME AGAIN IS MR. PLOW.
815	What? I sold it all for twenty-five bucks.
816	Cloud goes up. Cloud goes down. Cloud goes up. Cloud goes down...
817	"Bart, you have roots in this town and you ought to show respect for it. This town is a part of us all, a part of us all, a part of us all. Sorry to repeat myself but it'll help you remember."
818	It was healthy. He reciprocated. He reciprocated!
819	Would you do my kid's birthday party?
820	"I'm sure we will, honey."
821	I think we should put a stop sign at D Street and Twelfth. The other --
822	"Yeah, but he's cool with it. Right?"
823	Dad! It's three A.M.! Can't you mutter in your room?
824	This bird's gonna fly!
825	Are you... a hostess?
826	I wish -- we were bicycling to a lake.
827	You left a hole in my heart that could never be filled. So I filled it with food. But I'm never full.
828	So Patty. You're a woman who likes women. I guess that fear I always had of you stealing Homer away is unfounded.
829	Miss work? But my life would be nothing without the nucleon plant.
830	This is so hard because I always thought Mom was the strong one.
831	"Yeah, she's over in post now."
832	"Sorry, Mom, the mob has spoken."
833	"What's going on, why are you attacking me? Look, if this is about me eating your heart pills, they shouldn't have made them in Good 'N' Plenty colors!"
834	"Play ""Ain't Seen Nothing Yet!"""
835	"I can't say for sure, but as a Christian, I assume the worst."
836	I wash myself with a rag on a stick.
837	IT'S THE MOST WONDERFUL TIME OF THE YEAR...
838	"Homer, the capital of Kentucky is Frankfort."
839	Marge! This isn't a food restaurant! It's a meth restaurant! A meth-taurant!
840	"Mr. Burns, she's just a baby."
841	He locked the door! I'll show him.
842	The bad news keeps on coming.
843	Can you please just get us out of this lousy future?
844	"Keep your voices down, boys. We didn't come this far to get found out."
845	"They're ruining my whole life. Marge, please, this is where I need you the most. I'm counting on you to do something or say something to make it all better. Okay-- go."
846	"Oh, you're a dead man! Oh, you're dead! You're dead Burns!"
847	Many of you consider him to be a hideous genetic mutation. Nothing could be further from the truth. But don't take my word for it. Let's ask an actor portraying Charles Darwin what he thinks.
848	Carl spent all our money on this stupid page from a stupid saga.
849	Hey! Where's my junk?
850	"No, no one ever wants to hear about the importance of pants clips, do they?"
851	"Marge, unlike C.P.R., this is something I must know."
852	"Um, listen, I'm outta town next week, so..."
853	"That's right, I did the Iggy."
854	It's so rigid and uncreative.
855	"I am only eighty-one. You may find this hard to believe... but in my salad days, my crowning glory was a bright shock of strawberry blond curls."
856	"I'm not your buddy, you greedy old reptile!"
857	I miss holding you in my arms more than my butt can say.
858	And it's empty. Put it back! I don't wanna see it this way.
859	"Homie, I got you something to read on the plane."
860	My husband meant no harm. There must be some way he can pay for what he did. He's good at opening jars.
861	"Oh, I'm just reading up on, artillery."
862	"Sir, we'll need a new Dangerous Emissions Supervisor."
863	Milhouse Van Houten...will you do me the honor of ruining Krusty's wedding with me?
864	"Oh, memories. If this old place could talk, it'd say..."
865	"Oh, Jacques! It fits. You got it in my size and it has my name on it. It's really for me."
866	Fifteen-ninety-six...
867	"Bart, it's illegal for you to operate that class nine vehicle without pads and a helmet."
868	"One o'clock -- still just a potato.,one oclock -- still just a potato,7"
869	Can I get my ears pierced?
870	"Oh sure, when he does something bad, he's my father."
871	"No, no Japan. Jamaica! I wanna pass the doochie on the lefthand side."
872	I'm afraid your daily donuts are no more.
873	"Never better. The sun is shining, there's a spring in my slippers, and my wonderful son woke me up with a delicious cup of coffee."
874	"And yet, I miss America."
875	"Ah, I think I got your lunch."
876	Miracle breakthrough! There's been a miracle breakthrough?
877	Oh fine. We're putting in an on-board something-or-other and rack-and-peanut steering...
878	"It's not your fault, Homer. It's those lousy writers. They make me madder than a, um... yak in heat!"
879	Maybe you killed them all.
880	"Oh my God, this dude does the best Flanders! You got the mustache and the didilly... Okay, now do Wiggum."
881	I don't know what you're talking about.
882	"Marge, I ate it, it's over."
883	I'm giving you the beating of your life!
884	We don't have a Clapper.
885	"Don't correct the man, Brat. Oh, Boss, look what we brought... gelatin desserts."
886	"Aw, you know something Marge, it's not that tough being a film cricket."
887	Just give me ten more hours.
888	"Actually, that smoke is a little too inviting. Ah, throw on that sack of barber hair."
889	"Oh, here's fifty bucks. Take her to the Copa."
890	But we already did. Now I can't get it out of my head.
891	"If he's so smart, how come he can't stay outta my mouth?"
892	I'll be Lisui... the devil-may-care rocket pilot.
893	So when's Grampa getting here to babysit?
894	"You're right, I am. Help me, Marge. What do I do to be a good guy?"
895	LOVE LOVE WILL KEEP US TOGETHER
896	The biggest one in town.
897	"Ooo, looks like something exciting's happening. Well, we'll have to read about it in tomorrow's paper."
898	Come back with my thumb!
899	"Y'ello. This is he. Yeah I wanted to know: do you deliver falafels to the top of Mount Zion? Great. I'd like a large falafel with pepperoni, sausage and extra cheese. Yes, I know what a falafel is."
900	"...sermons about ""constancy"" and ""prudissitude"" are all very well and good, but the church could be doing so much more to reach out to people."
901	And now I am going to teach some kids a lesson.
902	"Tonight, we're here to serve you. Sit back and enjoy the finest foods Springfield has to offer."
903	Don't forget Ganesha.
904	"Uh, Mr. Burns, couldn't we patch the leak tomorrow? It's date night."
905	We feel neither highs nor lows.
906	"Not bad, not bad. Marge, how much do they pay us for doing this?"
907	He stole my fiancÃ©e.
908	Chocolate or regular?
909	"You missed the race, mama."
910	"What happened to that mini-cell phone I gave you, sir?"
911	Who wants to help me clear the table?
912	"There you are, you piece of crap."
913	They were looking at me. With their eyes.
914	"Lisa, there are a lot of people in the world who like to tell you what you can't do. But they don't always know what they're talking about."
915	"But enough about Bart. Tell me, Principal Skinner, are you married?"
916	"I'm not a nerd, Bart. Nerds are smart."
917	My husband's going to jail and it's all your fault! Do you know why no one likes you?
918	My baby has no future!
919	I don't know if toy drunkards are an appropriate gift for a baby.
920	You're going to die in a skydiving accident.
921	I just have one thing to say...
922	"This whole thing was a joke? Oh, I've never been so relieved! Relieved and angry."
923	"This is ridiculous. Only babies and ex-junkies are afraid of needles. Stick me, Chuckles!"
924	It's good for what ails ya...
925	I've been prying them apart since before you were born!
926	Only one of you monkeys wasn't caught with his sticky paw in my tin cup... Homer Simpson!
927	Exhausting. It took the children forty minutes to locate Canada on the map.
928	"Conductor, get ready to play my song!"
929	"Aw, it sounds like all you're looking for is a little reassurance. Well..."
930	"Oh Mom, I've missed you so much."
931	"And one time, during a speech, he was shot by a saloon-keeper -- but Teddy finished his speech before heading to the hospital!!"
932	"You know, I was voted best kisser in my P.O.W. camp."
933	It is so cool for you to let me go on tour with Cheech.
934	Heart condition? Get outta here.
935	All in favor of skipping the poem?
936	Judge Snyder? While we're young?
937	You're what? Selling light bulbs? Worried about the whales? Keen on Jesus? Out with it!
938	You don't understand. It's not just a sandwich. It's about brotherhood. It's about freedom. It's about three days since I've had one! I'm getting the shakes... and I'm getting the fries!
939	"Gentlemen, there's only one solution. We place this last donut in the reactor core, exposing it to radiation, thereby making it big."
940	"And I don't think you're boring. It's just that in today's multi-channel environment, you have too many great choices. Look at Sunday night. There's like eight amazing shows. None of them on Fox."
941	"Dad, I think someone's trying to kill you!"
942	"I don't know, Bart. My dad's a pretty big wheel down at the cracker factory."
943	"Lord, with you watching over me I shall feel no pain."
944	We'll let you know if your glasses turn up.
945	"Sir, my thyroid is swelling up."
946	It's about these pirates. Pirates with patches over their eyes... and shiny gold teeth... and green birds on their shoulders...
947	And I'm a wonderful man.
948	"Well, when I used to get stuck like this, I'd go for a bike ride. Do kids go on bike rides anymore?"
949	"All right, aim for the big hose coming out of his face."
950	"Oh, you have a girlfriend. Heh, heh, heh."
951	"Is ""TV Guide"" a book?"
952	The Old City. Where B.C. turned into A.D.! Let's go!
953	"Wow, you did learn a lot at 4-H."
954	I guess I'll never have a perfect Christmas.
955	"Stop saying things, Bart! That's the TV's job!"
956	Hide the sports section!
957	The half-assed approach to foundation repair.
958	You don't have to announce it. Just do it quietly and blame the dog.
959	I'll see what I can do.
960	His mother was a Shakespearean actress!
961	You can't do that to Duncan. It's not his fault that his owner was a sleaze.
962	Why are we still grifting? The car's paid for. Doesn't that balance out the universe?
963	You can't teach this way!
964	"Actually, those were Carl's shirts."
965	"What the?! Stupid calendar. First you put the Fourth of July on Sunday, and now this! Ooh, we're gonna discuss this later!"
966	Notice how the Keynesians climb trees while the Austrian school economists hide under rocks.
967	"Marge, an eagle is our country's mascot. Fighting him is like kicking George Washington in his wooden nuts!"
968	"Well, we'd better start our Love Day clean-up. You kids take care of the wrapping paper. I'm going to dismantle Love Land."
969	I thought Kearney was dating your Mom.
970	"Well, at least you remembered I like her."
971	Hope is all around me!
972	"If we're late for school, we'll miss our free federal breakfast!"
973	Maybe there's another way to solve this. Bart is clearly fulfilling an emotional need for Toot-Toot.
974	"Squeeze, squeeze... squeeze, squeeze. A real spider would get so mad if I did this! I wonder if this thing has batteries."
975	"Oh no, you can't 'cause, um, that's my dream! I'm gonna be Chief of Police!"
976	Something happened to Dad on that trip. This is worse than when he went to New Orleans and came back with the southern accent.
977	"Oh, he must smell leftovers."
978	"Yes, I do. The only girl I ever loved invited me up to the treehouse. She had something very important to tell me."
979	Listen to Lisa play her sax.
980	"Yeah, and a good dad wouldn't miss his son's Little League games!"
981	Disposed of them in an environmentally friendly manner!
982	That does it. I'm outta here.
983	You ratted him out? He's got a kid!
984	"Mr. Burns, it is my sad duty to report that one of your executives has bilked the company insurance plan out of a thousand dollars."
985	"It's horrible in here -- the boys beat me up, the girls beat me up..."
986	"Hello, police? Are you sitting down? Good. I wish to report a robbery!"
987	"Excuse me, Mr. Hutz. Are you a shyster?"
988	But he won't know where to go or what to eat.
989	Restraining order?! Bull spit! No piece of paper keeps me from whaling on my sister.
990	Dinner party at the neighbors'. At least I can drink.
991	I guess I'm gonna have to get this party started.
992	Look! A shooting star!
993	"Sorry I'm late, everyone. I had some trouble getting the voicemails off the nine-one-one line. Why does everyone have to talk so fast and panicky?"
994	"I'm not pouting, you are."
995	"I won't let you give up now, when you've worked so hard to be the greatest pal in the world. I love you. Let's not lose touch after graduation."
996	"Oh my gosh, that's beautiful! I've never seen a painting with a lighthouse before."
997	Head of the line! A family could get used to being shunned. Huh? Huh?
998	"Man alive, what a stinko thousand years! Blimp wrecks, teen-agers... then again, we had two TV shows with Andy Griffith."
999	"Don't worry, sweetie. With me at your side, our toast will do just what it's supposed to: steal focus from the bride."
1000	"That's right, then the Simpson genes kicked in."
1001	"I hate to be a nag, but this is my real head."
1002	"Hey, where'd that cool creepy Santa come from?"
1003	"Did somebody say ""naked bacon?"""
1004	"We don't have boarding passes, but we need to get on that plane for reasons that are utterly insane."
1005	"Solid. The rest of you, go on home and look in your mailboxes. 'Cause I totally remember sending checks out."
1006	"Because if I hit you back, we'll be even. But if I don't hit you, that makes me the better man. And I'm liking the way that feels."
1007	...your Ma says I should do something with you. Need some help with your homework?
1008	Yeah. Thank God that never happened.
1009	"Woo hoo! Look at me, I can juggle!"
1010	"I knew I had seen this exact scene somewhere else -- it was in the movie Mr. Lampwick showed me. Ladies and gentlemen, this drawing was made in 1919, nine years before Roger Myers made his first Itchy and Scratchy cartoon."
1011	"...que decÃ­a que hoy era mi dÃ­a dichoso. Primero no lo creÃ­, pero entonces me caÃ­ contra la maquina de dulces, ay, ay, ay!"
1012	"What can I say? I missed you, Myra."
1013	"It's okay, Homie. Go. Have a good time. Take Bart with you!"
1014	"Marge, Toot-Toot and her son escaped!"
1015	"Marge? Sorry. Marge? Oh, sorry. Marge?"
1016	"Lisa, look out! A skeleton!"
1017	What the hell was that?!
1018	How come we have to go to church and Dad gets to stay home and watch cartoons?
1019	We're going to build the world's tallest human pyramid!
1020	"What about... you know... ""Stinky""?"
1021	"Have a good day at work, honey."
1022	"Well, Simpsie, you up for another wave?"
1023	No! You're ruining the show. Oh... Oh... Oh. Stop.
1024	"She's not my girlfriend. She's a girl who I married, who used to be my friend."
1025	Did the maniac kill her?
1026	They've taken everything!
1027	Here it is: The Harmless Chair of Relaxation!
1028	"But they might be paving over rare specimens. Pull over so we can complain, Dad. Come on, who wants to complain with me?"
1029	On a beautiful night like tonight... how could I not?
1030	"Simpson, what a pleasant surprise. We were just pulling taffy."
1031	"Dad, remember when Tom had you in that headlock and you screamed, ""I'm a hemophiliac"" and when he let you go you kicked him in the back?"
1032	"Homer Simpson, you devil! But I think we should unpack first..."
1033	Look everybody! I'm the same person I always was.
1034	"Well, the comic's ours as much as it is yours."
1035	"Well, Maggie likes Roofi. And babies only like good things."
1036	"It may be bleak, but this music is really getting to the crowd."
1037	"Let's just enjoy our happiness, Homie. Accidental motherhood is the greatest thing that can happen to a woman. And I think Bart's finally outgrown his misbehavior."
1038	"But, Dad, I don't drink..."
1039	Hey! Get a load of that spread.
1040	Flanders! You're the devil?
1041	"Oh, right. Well Lisa, Mabel knew her husband well, so she had cooked up a little ""payback pie..."""
1042	"Molloy said, 'I'll catch up with you.'"
1043	He's nothing but hard bronze muscle.
1044	"Boy, those Germans have a word for everything."
1045	"You mean the mob only did me a favor to get something in return? Oh, Fat Tony... I will say good day to you, sir."
1046	"Thanks guys, I um... huh, this collar's feelin' pretty tight."
1047	"Oh Dad, you do remember something about me. Perhaps you also remember this laser Bart gave me earlier!"
1048	"Okay, okay I'll let him. But then I get a chipwich, okay?"
1049	I never knew Jim Belushi made so many movies.
1050	"Ahh, these minstrels will soothe my jangled nerves."
1051	"Mr. Simpson, do you think it's appropriate for a ten-year-old boy to steal a beer with intent to kiss?"
1052	But I'm going to give gifts that aren't expensive and come from the heart.
1053	"Hello there, Flan-didly-danders."
1054	Oh! The little tiger tries so hard. Why does he keep failing?
1055	"Lawyers... lawyers. Ooh, Lionel Hutz. ""Cases won in 30 minutes or your pizza's free."""
1056	"Apartment Finder: We put you in your place. ""Roommate wanted for three bedroom apartment. Spacious, river view, only four hundred dollars a month!"" Thank you, news box... It's gone!"
1057	My childhood paradise -- it's a dump!
1058	"Hey, I remember you. Mayor Quimby, right?"
1059	"Tell her I'm at a meeting, not drinking..."
1060	"Me? Just what in my long, sad history with frogs makes you think I can take care of a bird?"
1061	"Hold on, lemme get the door here."
1062	"Act your age, Simpson! You look foolish!"
1063	"Oh, my little Maggie, I may never hold you again... ew, stinky pants."
1064	Hey kids! It's time for Itchy & Scratchy!
1065	"Good morning, Mr. Burns. Beautiful day to be outside, isn't it?"
1066	"Homer, Helen Lovejoy never returned my casserole dish from the church potluck. Could you pick it up?"
1067	Coming! I haven't forgotten about the sausage.
1068	"You know, I did sit on a shark once..."
1069	"Right, right, too soon. Do you have my money?"
1070	"No way. I don't need any shrink, therapist, counselor, motivational speaker or ""guru""."
1071	I'm so glad you could join us for Homer's big premiere.
1072	"I held up two, for ""peely!"""
1073	"Wait a minute, there's no Angus MacCloud in North Kilt-town. Why you're not from Scotland at all!"
1074	But then I won't be watching TV. You can see the bind I'm in.
1075	There's a whole rack of 'em over there. I only ate two.
1076	That man is beyond redemption!
1077	"Hey, I'm happy to see Milhouse get some hand-on-hand action. But no one is cooler than Bartholomew J. Simpson."
1078	"Hey, I love waking up drunk in the morning."
1079	Great. I'll do the pony while you do the lions.
1080	Can't you get it yourself?
1081	I was in an anecdote once!
1082	Don't you serve anything that's even remotely Japanese?
1083	I also fed some ducklings.
1084	"Hello. I'm looking for something in a pipe cleaner. Extra bendy, with medium fuzz."
1085	The school sent this dealy over for Maggie. His name is Phonic Frog.
1086	Lisa! Dad! C'mere quick! There is something that you won't believe!
1087	"There are no small parts, just small actors."
1088	"Mr. McGrew! I love that blind, senile old man."
1089	Ten... E-le-ven... TWELVE!
1090	What I did made the TV thing happen.
1091	"Oh, geez, I told you, Bernie. To guard the bee."
1092	"I thought after all you went through, you just might want to spend an hour in a place where you felt at home."
1093	Nothing could be farther from the...
1094	Because I'm a screw-up. My sister's the smart one -- all I do is get in trouble.
1095	"Hey pal, what are you in here for?"
1096	"Oh, I love legitimate theater."
1097	"All right, but just be careful."
1098	I think we all had that idea.
1099	"Man, how many quarters does this game take?"
1100	I've been saying it for three weeks! But every time I open my mouth...
1101	We used to be like them.
1102	"Herb, this is the stupidest thing I've ever seen. I can't believe we blew two thousand bucks on it, when right now rollers could be kneading my buttocks."
1103	"...so if I keep my mouth shut, you get me new wheelie sneakers, and Bart agrees to promote and encourage use of my new cool nickname, ""C.J.""..."
1104	"Oh, well, he may be a horrible freak, but he's still my son. I'm sure we'll grow to accept him in time."
1105	He must be following this thing. Well I'm gonna make sure it never harms another living creature.
1106	You monster! My knees will be in my throat!
1107	"Oh, why did I register with Insta-trace?"
1108	Keep him away from me.
1109	"O-kay, this guy's taken care of so, uh, you know..."
1110	You know I would never do anything to hurt your feelings. Good night.
1111	"Well, sweetie... I know I said you couldn't have a cell phone, but, in these days of stranger dangers and sinister ministers, I think it's important that we're in touch."
1112	"Well, better turn off that engine. Before those fumes put us in tombs."
1113	"I knew you'd do well, Homer."
1114	Okay. But every man deserves a second chance. As long as he doesn't...
1115	"Yes, that describes Kathy in Personnel to a tee!"
1116	I used Grampa's money to try to help someone in need. But it didn't go the way I expected.
1117	"I have been ""eighty-nine"" for a while now."
1118	"Absolutely -- that unpleasantness in Ecuador is behind us, my coca leaf addiction is under control , and Bart is finally trapped in that paradise above the clouds."
1119	You make me feel that way too.
1120	It's the Sting-y and Battery Show! THEY BITE / AND LIGHT / AND BITE AND LIGHT AND BITE! BITE BITE BITE... YADDA YADDA YOU KNOW WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT...
1121	Then I'll whomp him with my hat.
1122	"Janey, school is never a waste of time."
1123	"Oh, I'm a baby, huh? Well, then I'll act like a baby."
1124	"I can't go along with this, Homer."
1125	"Smithers, check out the luscious pair on that red-head. That's it, baby. Work those ankles."
1126	"I can't afford any of your products, but can I buy some fake white earbuds, so people will think I have a MyPod?"
1127	I can't hear you. Wait! Fly into my saxophone!
1128	"And if I wanna watch it, what day?"
1129	And who could forget dear Rat boy?
1130	"Oh, very well, it's time for your bribe. Now you can either have the washer and dryer where the lovely Smithers is standing..."
1131	I wish. I made these at work.
1132	What happened to you two?
1133	"Bart, this guy's walked the last two batters, and if he walks you, we win the game. Don't swing at anything!"
1134	Aren't there any good bachelors in this town?
1135	And which side was I on?
1136	"If you're gonna get snippy, I'll take my business elsewhere."
1137	"Yeah, I love Sprawl-Mart. They've got everything. Even Christian videos with talking vegetables."
1138	We'll never sell this rotten dump.
1139	No! No drugs. Bart just needs a little discipline.
1140	A long-lost half-brother. How Dickensian!
1141	"Outta my way, you God-fearing Buckleheads!"
1142	We all got problems. I dropped my cookie.
1143	"You were born while they were married so legally, no. But in the sense someone calls you one when they're angry, yes."
1144	"Science has already proven the dangers of smoking, alcohol and Chinese food. But I can still ruin soft drinks for everyone."
1145	"I see. So if my old bike didn't work, I would automatically get a new one?"
1146	Not really. They just had corn on them. Kitchen -- corn.
1147	Why can't we visit a real museum? One that doesn't have the skeletons of the Three Stooges in the lobby?
1148	"Doctor, we don't have a dental plan right now. So we'll need something a little more... affordable."
1149	"No, I just encouraged him."
1150	Where on my badge does it say anything about protecting people?
1151	"No. Let's go home. We can enjoy some mixed ""marital"" arts."
1152	"Uh, do you think that's wise, Mr. Burns? I mean... think of the headlines."
1153	Do I have to hang out with them?
1154	"Eww, we're gonna do our grocery shopping at a 99-Cent Store?"
1155	I repeat: no one will ever know.
1156	Dentist?! You said we were going to ride dirt bikes around the cemetery!
1157	You probably do this all the time! This whole family is built on a tissue of lies and romance!
1158	"Well, the school's having a bake sale."
1159	"Better half, Marge. ""Better half."""
1160	Hitchhike -- it's faster!
1161	"Geez, way to burst my bubble, Marge."
1162	But he's a loser. He's pathetic. He's...
1163	I steamed the letter open with Moe's cappuccino machine.
1164	"Yeah, but you always wind up kidnapped, or on a chain gang... and I don't even want to get into what happened on our honeymoon."
1165	"Oh my God! I know you must get this all the time, but can I suggest a flavor?"
1166	I made you a coffee mug on Mother's Day! Isn't that enough?
1167	And I'm gonna keep teaching your class. Like it or lump it.
1168	"If I had won Class President, I'd be the one getting thrown up in the air right now."
1169	I want the most intelligent hamster you've got.
1170	"Well, Marge, you can't say I never take you anywhere."
1171	"Oh, a swinging bachelor, eh? Well, there's lots of foxy ladies out there..."
1172	Poor Tony. He didn't deserve this. He was just a soldier in a war he started.
1173	This is late for Marge. I assume. I've never been home at this hour.
1174	"Probably, but a cruciverbalist is a fan of crossword puzzles -- which I am!"
1175	"Hey, Homer, how come Mom's going to the doctor?"
1176	"Look -- there's writing on the ""R!"""
1177	"No, I've already planned our vacation. We're going to the Highway 9 Bird Sanctuary. I understand they've installed a new bird feeder this year."
1178	"C'mon, boy. All the nerds are doin' it."
1179	I'm not going to give up. I refuse to believe that everyone refuses to believe the truth.
1180	I wouldn't blow my nose into this.
1181	"I'll save you, honey!"
1182	"With that attitude, you'll never super in one of my buildings!"
1183	"No, the Army said I was too heavy. The police said I was too dumb."
1184	"Also, could you tell her I'm dumping her? After eleven years, the thrill is gone."
1185	No TV on a smart phone!
1186	"I must have her. Smithers, zoom in. Closer... Closer... closer, damn it!"
1187	"Oh my God, I want a brother!"
1188	"Marge, we need some more vanilla-chocolate-and-strawberry ice cream."
1189	"Dad, you can't keep this up for long."
1190	"Sewing a new quilt. You know, it's one thing to be a link in a chain. It's another to start one of your own."
1191	You should be livin' like there's no tomorrow. And I know just the place.
1192	I meant a week from tomorrow. That's when the new penis gets here.
1193	"Well, you're not really a trucker now."
1194	"Well let's just call 'em uh, ""Mr. X"" and ""Mrs. Y."" So anyway, Mr. X would say, 'Marge, If this doesn't get your motor running, my name isn't Homer J. Simpson.'"
1195	"Oh-ho-ho-ho, please. You're gonna give me a swelled head. I just stopped by to see if you needed anything."
1196	No! Should I attach it for you?
1197	"Hey, what's so funny?"
1198	"One, two, three, four! Up, down, three, four..."
1199	It's the law. My hands are tied.
1200	"So, I beat the system."
1201	"Oh Homer, I didn't want you to find out this way. We were planning a surprise party for you."
1202	No. Let's do another twenty miles.
1203	"That's a very violent image, Lisa."
1204	"Oh... uh... yeah. When you're right, you're right. Let's eat."
1205	"Dad, can I ask you a question? How did you ever get a woman like Mom to stay with you?"
1206	"Did I hear ""lettuce?"""
1207	"Final score: Bart, forty-one. Homer... let's see, six plus six plus six plus six plus six plus six..."
1208	"Homer, I'm not pregnant."
1209	I couldn't believe my eye.
1210	"Nah, his game was blackjack. He bet our life savings on a single hand."
1211	Almost time for our commercial.
1212	"Yeah, yeah, yeah. Let me just put this holy grail in my trophy room."
1213	She's right. We thought we could enter the den of sin and emerge unscathed. But we were scathed! Those free ginger ales at the casino... I didn't declare them on my taxes!
1214	But I'll need someone to watch my house. Who's that fellow who always screws up and creates havoc?
1215	Someone's listening to me! Now I know how a radio feels!
1216	"Wow, you're right, Dad. It is windy."
1217	"Yes, Principal Skinner."
1218	The caper is writing a kids' fantasy novel.
1219	"You can't just kill off a classic TV character. Poochie could be bigger than curly fries, but first he has to win back the audience. That's why I'm gonna read these lines I wrote myself with my own two hands."
1220	Really? You think people would be Kent-rested in me?
1221	"I can't go to a gay bar, I'm too fat! Moe, I'm gonna help you reopen your bar no matter what it takes."
1222	"Sergeant Activity, your mission is to scale the icy walls of Mount Bloodkill!"
1223	Why should America consume ninety percent of the world's resources? Argentina must devalue her currency to pay her debts!
1224	"Oh, why isn't this working?"
1225	Hi-dilly-ho Shary Bobbins!
1226	"Hmm. Well, you can stay at my house until then. My parents won't mind, because they won't even know about it."
1227	"Oh, I get it. Here's ten bucks."
1228	"Keep it down in there, everybody."
1229	Here they come! Raise the flag!
1230	And it's still got a roll of film in it.
1231	You can't give me a yellow card?! You're my father!
1232	I'M GETTING USED TO NEVER GETTING NOTICED.
1233	Just because you've had a little setback doesn't mean you can't look your best.
1234	"Rhetorical, eh? Eight."
1235	"This barbecue will be hard, thankless work, but I'm sure you're up to it, Marge."
1236	"We've got all your favorite characters -- Itchy, Scratchy, Poochie, Austin Powers Itchy, Itchy Poochie, Scratchbob Itchpants, Confederate Itchy and Osama Bin Scratchy."
1237	I can hardly believe this is real.
1238	You did this?! With your fat fingers and your brain the size of a super ball?!
1239	"You know, I heard if a fat guy stops moving, he floats."
1240	"We can't wait to see it, sweetie."
1241	"Honey, I appreciate the thought, but just leave everything to me."
1242	"Good night, Lisa. Good ni-ight!"
1243	We didn't say anything.
1244	"Just fish... chicken... burgers... veal on Fridays... deer, but only in season... and if necessary, the sweetest meat of all... human."
1245	"Dad, I thought Mom kicked you out of the house."
1246	Seems like the classy thing to do would be not to call attention to it.
1247	Always nice to see him.
1248	"Don't worry, I've been working on it. Hm... yes... uh huh... carry the two..."
1249	"Fine, I guess. Thanks for loaning me your pajamas, Homer. And Marge, thank you for those helpful chip bag clips."
1250	"All these - spoiled - brats - and - their - smug, complacent parents. It just reinforces...the unspoken - class - system - of... horses - sitting - on - their - high... horses I'm sorry. I gotta go!"
1251	"Aw, come on, sourpuss. Tickle tickle!"
1252	"Ohhhhh, bed! Oh. Well, anything you say, sis."
1253	"I'm sorry, your honor. I've led a worthless life. I've been this way since I was a little... squirt!"
1254	"Hey, idiot. You're fat, and your Mom's naked on the internet. You also smell."
1255	"I should be resisting this, but I'm paralyzed with rage... and island rhythms."
1256	But I seem to be trapped in here.
1257	Well putting my arms in sleeves is about all I got to offer a woman.
1258	"Well, I bet they miss me."
1259	"No, Lisa. The only monster here is the gambling monster that has enslaved your mother. I call him Gamblor. And it's time to snatch your mother from his neon claws."
1260	"Maybe I can make some money, Dad. My magic act is really coming along."
1261	"Suddenly, I was invited to every birthday party. Sometimes I'd have to read the cake just to know who I was singing to."
1262	"Hey Milhouse, cool jacket!"
1263	"Wow, look at all the stars you can see here."
1264	Aw... but I do hope you'll try to be good from now on.
1265	You're panhandling! I should have known from that panhandling sign! Plus that ticket you got for panhandling.
1266	"Oh, I just love it here. So many things, and so many things of each thing!"
1267	Looks like it. Run get Daddy's exorcism tongs.
1268	Saratoga slam! Aristotle's dilemma! Knickerbocker knucklebreaker! And so on.
1269	I wanna show you I understand how you feel. And they say a picture's worth a thousand words:
1270	"Mom, why are you talking like that?"
1271	"Hey, since when is Christmas just about the presents? Aren't we forgetting the true meaning of this day? The birth of Santa?"
1272	I lost my job as an oaf today.
1273	"Homer, send these people home. This housewarming party's been going on for two days."
1274	"Really?... They sound like... I mean... well, the thing..."
1275	"Marge, I can't say no to a helpless old lady. They put spells on you!"
1276	SUGAR. DO DO DO DO DO DO AWWW. HO--NEY. HO.....NEYYY. DO DO DO DO DO DO. / YOU ARE MY CANDY GIRRRRL Lousy piece of junk!
1277	"Are you from the orphanage, or do I really not understand how babies are born?"
1278	That song was very nice. How'd you think up so many rhyming words?
1279	That's it. He's outta here.
1280	"You want money? Get a job, like your old man."
1281	"You're alive! But, but how?!"
1282	"I hate to interrupt while you're rejoicing, but Maggie is terribly itchy."
1283	"Bart, you're not annoyed that Milhouse asked me to go to the American football game instead of you?"
1284	"Uh, um... How's your wife Nancy?"
1285	"So, workin' hard or hardly workin'?"
1286	We had to move out once we'd filled the head with garbage. The end.
1287	"Fine. It's not important. What really matters is my title. I think I'll make myself Vice President. No, wait... Junior Vice President."
1288	"Well, somebody go first."
1289	"Look, Lisa. I put new filaments in all our burned-out light bulbs. Your father the millionaire thought we should throw these away."
1290	"Mom, you've been cooking all night?"
1291	"Hi, Homer Simpson. Mind if I sit near your son? Mine sucks."
1292	"Yeah, for about a week. But as soon as they get to know the real you, they departo de Barto. And that's why you're alone tonight."
1293	What? Nunchuks? Those aren't even Australian.
1294	"Dear Homer Simpson -- Mr. Burns invites you to a hunting party at his private estate. Parenthesis, sinister laugh, closed parenthesis."
1295	Then what's America doing in Iraq?
1296	"Well, I can't risk it. I won't allow that Simpson boy to take the Hellfish Bonanza, and I can't get it without his key!"
1297	No! I want everyone to know that this is Ned Flanders... my friend!
1298	We're getting 50% of the T-shirt sales.
1299	"Oh sure. Last resort... Old Grampa, the feeb. The guy who can't be counted on for nothing, no how, dagnabit. Everyone's agin me. I'll do it."
1300	I'm a litigious business man and I need a coffee to go.
1301	"Well, ain't that somethin'."
1302	"Look, there's nothing more important to me than you guys. I f..."
1303	"Hey, what gives, man?"
1304	"No, please! I can't bear another thrashing. Just leave me be."
1305	"CHAKA KHAN, LET ME ROCK YOU / LET ME ROCK YOU, CHAKA KHAN / CHAKA KHAN CHAKA KHAN..."
1306	"Nice chair toss. Good one, skinny. / You guys get these chairs from Regal Rents? / Boy, you're a great stacker. / Hi, Lisa. / Now that's precarious."
1307	"I never dreamed the future could be scary. Let's go, Lisa. We've got some worms to save!"
1308	"Sorry, Dad. Maybe now you'll appreciate us..."
1309	"Yeah, I hope I get it too. Later!"
1310	"And here's the clincher... Ray Magini is an anagram for ""imaginary."""
1311	That's my brass knee... Steel hip... That one's news to me.
1312	I don't think I really captured the eyes.
1313	"That wasn't scary at all, Bart."
1314	I know. It's where I hide my adult magazines.
1315	"Well, it's time to say ""good night."""
1316	"Are you my guardian angel? If so, can you turn a pumpkin into a chariot? Even a used Camry would be okay."
1317	"Thanks, but I'm going into bootleg DVDs."
1318	"For me? Bobo? Smithers, I'm so happy. Something amazing has happened. I'm actually happy. Take a note. From now on, I'm only going to be good and kind to everyone."
1319	"Hey, knock it off! These pants cost six hundred dollars!"
1320	What do they do? What don't they do! Oh they do so many things... they never stop... oh the things they do there! My stars.
1321	But Homer tries his best.
1322	A mother knows everything about her family.
1323	Not hang out. Play date!
1324	"Thank you, son. And do you think you could stop the casual swearing?"
1325	Na na na na / Na na na na /
1326	"No, no, I'd like to see the manager."
1327	I live in that place!
1328	"That's it, Lis. Now start crawling."
1329	"Well, I'll show ya. Follow me."
1330	It is a gorgeously fabulous day. Marvelous even.
1331	"Oh, come on, Homer. By the end, you were so bored you could barely keep your selfish head up."
1332	Well... do you ever take an interest in anything he does?
1333	I like it in the cage. These cedar shavings are a helluva lot better than my lumpy mattress.
1334	That takes care of my next one.
1335	"That Yentl puts the ""she"" in Yeshiva."
1336	That's my grease! It's mine! Give it here!
1337	That proves the painting is mine! And nothing can stop me from selling it and keeping all the money!
1338	"But according to your most recent biography, you only have one hundred million dollars today."
1339	Hey kids. How was school?
1340	Wow. Can you do that again?
1341	"Well, if he would stop wearing the banana suntan lotion!"
1342	"Well, good. I'm coming home, honey. You can pick me up at the train station in an hour. And bring the kids. Bye!"
1343	All I want is a battery.
1344	"Oh Lord, I know my new wife is a little more... ""peppermint"" than you're used to. But, uh, I know you'd want me to honor my sacred vows, so I will."
1345	Hey everybody! Who thinks Flanders should shut up?
1346	"If I knock him out, I'll be a hero. And people will listen to my loose-brained nonsense."
1347	No talking like a grizzled 1890's prospector... consarnit!
1348	I have a book from the library with the same information!
1349	We bought a wicker basket from Pier One and he was passed out inside.
1350	My next-door neighbor? Religious guy?
1351	What happened to our town? Everybody wears clothes from the past and uses computers from the future!
1352	"Yeah, Dad. / Yeah. / We love you."
1353	"Okay guys, here's the deal -- I've gone bald."
1354	Your memory bubble and you.
1355	"Hey, do you know anything about fixing sports cars?"
1356	Get... in... the tent!
1357	"That's disgusting. And besides, when a woman loves a man, it doesn't matter that a crocodile bit off his face."
1358	Forget it! One day a week I should be able to put on nice clothes and have someone bring food to me!
1359	"Back then, we didn't care what anyone thought, and the chicks found that irresistible."
1360	I wish I hadn't bought a hundred of these.
1361	"You know, the one with all the well-meaning rules that don't work out in real life -- Christianity."
1362	"Oh, Marge, don't blame yourself. I'm the terrible parent. The boy bugs the hell outta me, I can't help Lisa with her homework. The only thing I'm fit to take care of is a houseplant."
1363	The basis of this game seems to be simple geometry. All you have to do is hit the ball here.
1364	"Ohhh my God, I am such a huge, huge fan of yours, Miss Basinger."
1365	"You just don't get it, do you, Homer? You told personal things about our lives even after you promised you wouldn't. I can't trust you anymore."
1366	Wait a minute! We haven't heard from me yet. The nut with the dynamite. The phone company is bamboozling you!
1367	All right! A care bucket.
1368	Moe's Tavern Grand Opening... That was back when his floors were sticky with promise.
1369	Oh. And who is Warren Burke?
1370	Hmmm. Hmmm. Not bad. Interesting.
1371	There. Now no one should be able to hear us.
1372	"Wait, let me check the book."
1373	"Actually, bees rarely sting when they're in a cluster. They only attack to defend their hive."
1374	"Marge, this has been great couples time. The one thing people with kids desperately need is no kids!"
1375	"Naw, that kinda creeps me out."
1376	"Welly, welly, welly... Mr. Clean wants to hang with Dirty Dingus Magee."
1377	"Gomer upsets Sergeant Carter. Ooooh, I'll never forget that episode!"
1378	"Find any winners, son?"
1379	"Come on... Come on, Angel."
1380	Sssh! I want her to think I'm cool!
1381	"Good gravy, what have I done?"
1382	It's so unfair. You're everything a dad could hope for.
1383	"Fine. I want one gift bag now, and one when the party's over."
1384	"Yeah, she's the best. Ooo, can you imagine her face on her body?"
1385	Sure! You'll find it gets rid of the unpleasant after-taste of church.
1386	Absolutely not. My little girl's tummy hurts. Do you have anything to stop her complaining?
1387	Sweet mint julep... I'll be at Moe's.
1388	Ann Landers is a boring old biddy.
1389	"Now... hey, listen! Now, my story begins in 19-dickety-two. We had to say ""dickety"" 'cause the Kaiser had stolen our word ""twenty."" I chased that rascal to get it back, but gave up after dickety-six miles."
1390	I'll bet we could buy a nice doghouse for fifty dollars.
1391	"That's it! I've hit rock bottom. Well, my comeback starts now!"
1392	"But before I go, I'm gonna give you a little souvenir of my own."
1393	"Dad, this is a kid's menu where you help Yogi Bear get to the Washington Monument."
1394	"We're still cool though, right?"
1395	"Okay, everyone! Back to work! You never know when we might uncover a Tyrannosaurus."
1396	"We were good, Dad. They asked us to play in the Krusty Klassic!"
1397	"Oh, why not? Everybody's doin' it."
1398	How do we catch her without hurting her?
1399	But I was gonna loot you a present!
1400	"Broken-Leg Beauty, ""Sorry, Silver,"" ""No More Mint Juleps..."" And the fourth one has a title so sad I can't even say it."
1401	Where's an electric sidewalk when you need one?
1402	"Now, let's think about this. If you shoot me, I won't be able to stop you and you'll be free to go. But someone may come after you. Probably not, given your reputation for shooting people who come after you. What I'm trying to say is, not shooting me now would be the biggest mistake of your life."
1403	Take another bath in malt liquor?
1404	Boogie boogie boogie boogie boogie!
1405	I'm sorry your surprise party was spoiled.
1406	"Yeah, yeah. Do we have any pencils that work?"
1407	"Hey Lis, we learned so much scootin' around Vermont. Did you know that candles are made by losers?"
1408	You have octuplets. It rolls off your tongue and into your heart: octuplets.
1409	"You're getting a cab, old man. In fact, I believe I see it now."
1410	Why don't you just take my blood?
1411	Can't you just use this recent photo?
1412	DAD LEFT THE MILK OUT / YUCK YUCK YUCK YUCK YUCK...
1413	"Hi! This lighting's a little bright. And um, could I get a red wash in the background?"
1414	"Don't worry, honey, I'll be your ""seeing-eye Homer."" We're in some kind of doctor room, bunch of stuff on the walls... it's kind of hard to describe... Um, I'm gonna take my break now."
1415	Continue aiming... Still aiming...
1416	"We do have them! They're my home screen! Miss Hoover! Once again, the lesson plan I prepared would've covered this topic much better, but I can see..."
1417	UP ABOVE THE WORLD SO HIGH / LIKE A DIAMOND IN THE SKY...
1418	Back you robots! Nobody ruins my family vacation but me. And maybe the boy.
1419	"The Dome of the Rock? Messiah, away!"
1420	I hope Dylan likes trucks.
1421	I said we were having a special guest tonight -- Mr. Tim Conway.
1422	"Well then, I guess I have no choice."
1423	"Barnacle Bill's Home Pregnancy Test? Homer, shouldn't we have gone with a better-known brand?"
1424	"Nope, everybody's paid up."
1425	"Damnation, Smithers! This idea of yours to immortalize me in a portrait was as half-baked as your idea about me having children!"
1426	"Ahhh. I'm just a big toasty cinnamon bun. I never want to leave this bed. Uh-oh. Gotta take a whiz. Think, man, think... think, think, think. I better get up."
1427	Homer! That is not banishment-hearing behavior!
1428	"Well, that's the end of Dad's wedding business."
1429	"Homer, what's happened to you? All this greediness and lying and shifty lawyers and phony doctors --"
1430	"If I bet it, I could double it. But on who?"
1431	I'm the one who told you that.
1432	"Chapter Six: Four Days in Philadelphia. The first Continental Congress faced a difficult job. Could the delegates agree on recommendations that all Americans could support?,chapter six four days in philadelphia the first continental congress faced a difficult job could the delegates agree on recommendations that all americans could support,25"
1433	"Don't worry, Dad. Maybe this is just for suspense before the miracle happens."
1434	"See, Maggie. The ocean is just like a bathtub. Except instead of rubber ducks, it has barracudas and moray eels."
1435	Your putter's name is Charlene!
1436	I'll prove I'm not crazy. Sideshow Bob could never resist singing along to a Gilbert and Sullivan operetta.
1437	"So long, kids. Give my regards to the British Museum."
1438	Can't take the pain...
1439	"I can't back out. This is for a cause that's bigger than I am. If Gandhi could go without eating for a whole three-hour movie, I can do this. Besides, I'm a woman. He'll probably go easy on me."
1440	Really? You really think I'm better than you?
1441	"Look, can we get to the point? I'm stack parked. Did you hear me? Stack..."
1442	"That's a trust, Janey. A sacred trust."
1443	I hate this. I don't want to go.
1444	"Guys, Bob is my only hope. Back off and give him some room to think."
1445	No! That bridge has a troll under it!
1446	"Wait, something's screwy here. I'm callin' the cops."
1447	Isn't that a Christmas tie?
1448	"By building a casino, I could tighten my stranglehold on this dismal town!"
1449	"Oh, I can't wait to see my surprise!"
1450	Wow. So this is what it feels like to be a pregnant lady.
1451	"Everyone seemed so happy, but I'm surprised at Ned. He left out all the good times Cain and Abel had when they were growing up."
1452	"Hold that thought. Bacon up that sausage, boy."
1453	Maybe someone else is here. And maybe he'll step forward and admit to being the real culprit.
1454	"That's okay. I can handle it. Homie, why don't you just relax and have a little soup?"
1455	"You heard me, Duchess. It's mine and I'm saving it."
1456	Just put on the KISS record.
1457	"Dad, look, a corn maze!"
1458	"Anything, huh? Okay... I want pizza, and I want it delivered by Krusty the Clown."
1459	"Moe the tavern, not Moe the person."
1460	"If you're lucky, me, then this."
1461	Bart! This is America. Anyone can eat what they want as long as they eat too much.
1462	"I'd like to help you, Chief, but my license was revoked. Seems I'm full of rage."
1463	"Hm. Well, did you see that picture of me in..."
1464	"I don't believe so, no. Anyway, this ""intel"" says that someone in town has been turned, and they're working for terrorists."
1465	A Buddhist wouldn't want any.
1466	"Whatever you want, sweetie."
1467	...WALKING IN A WINTER WONDERLAND.
1468	"Uh, maybe I need to talk to somebody with a little more age and wisdom."
1469	I'm not exactly flattered by that.
1470	"These kids are gettin' a little out of hand, Kent, so we're gonna have to fire the time-out gas."
1471	"Yeah, I wanna hallucinate too!"
1472	"Well, this time you must be punished."
1473	"I have problems, too."
1474	This is madness. He's just peddling a bunch of easy answers.
1475	He just needs it for walking upstairs.
1476	"Marge, are you all right?"
1477	None of my biological kids ever wanted to see me at work.
1478	"What, do you think I'm crazy?"
1479	Good ol' Evergreen Terrace. The swankiest street in the classiest part of Pressboard Estates.
1480	"Say goodbye to Grampa, everyone."
1481	"Don't worry, homeboy, you're not that fast."
1482	"Smithers, my wallet's in my right front pocket."
1483	Kick him in the ribs...
1484	It's true! It would be a cold day in Hell when I was popular.
1485	Welcome to Sprawl-Mart!
1486	Now who's being naive.
1487	It could only be one thing.
1488	Keep it down in there!
1489	Who's he giving a piggyback ride to?
1490	"Oh my Lord. Well, I don't want to wait another minute to find out whether you love me anymore. I think that you should look me in the eyes and find out."
1491	"Oh, there's so little left: Creamed Eels? Corn Nog? Wadded beef?"
1492	"Here you go, Todd. The city edition."
1493	Go Seminoles! Cover-the-point-spread! Cover-the-point-spread!
1494	We have to get you to the emergency room!
1495	"Now's your chance, Duffman! You can save my Dad and look like a hero!"
1496	"So Burns, do you want to explain how this miracle of measure and harmony got into your collection?"
1497	"Oh my God, she fainted! Let's go get smelling salts!"
1498	"You had me at ""five-course,"" you lost me at ""romantic,"" and you got me back at ""dinner."""
1499	"You gotta get on your game, sister. You think I'm tough? Wait till Gutierrez sinks her teeth into you."
1500	But asking you was Ralph's idea.
1501	Can I get out of the dog carrier?
1502	"Hmmm, hmmm. Looking for the spot... Hmmm, hmmm, hmmm... Still checking. This is so stupid... I'm not gonna find anything... Just because I wrecked something she worked really hard on and I made her cr... Uh-oh!"
1503	"Oh, really? And how are you gonna do that?"
1504	That'll teach you to teach me!
1505	"Homer, I think we should go. We're not like these people."
1506	"You know, I should get back to the treadmill."
1507	"Mom, that's Roofi. His music is why babies are idiots."
1508	... and just a few stars down from the Cheerios Honey Bee.
1509	"It's okay, Marge. We don't need to go on a trip. We'll just wait for the killer bees to come to us."
1510	Yesssss! Oh yessss! Read it and weep. In your face. I've got more chicken bone!
1511	"Dad, remember those self-hypnosis classes we took to help us ignore Grampa?"
1512	"Well, maybe a sip. I don't want to offend our mentalist."
1513	"Mr. Burns took away their sanctuary, and now they aren't strong enough to survive on their own."
1514	"All right, Homer. Let's see what my baby's been up to."
1515	This cape is giving me a rash.
1516	Huh? Oh. I sure did!... Here's a bus schedule.
1517	He's ready to give up the drudgery of the professional mambo circuit and settle into a nice teaching job.
1518	"Oh my God, I've only got nine seconds till Marge's show!"
1519	"Dad, they have those everywhere."
1520	"Look Marge, I can tell something's bothering you. But if you come out of that car, I promise to do whatever it takes to make it better. Please, honey?"
1521	"They said if I come in late again, I'm fired. I can't take that chance."
1522	Stop -- in the name of a private citizen with no connection to the law!
1523	"Do you really need the boy's help to make a baby? Just do a little of the bunga-bunga, and the hotsie-potsie, and the bop-bada-bop-bada-bop."
1524	"Even you, Caveman Homer."
1525	"I've got to, honey. I owe it to ol' Red, as both his friend and his killer."
1526	No monologue. Roll the cartoon.
1527	But they are morons. What grown person could believe in angels?
1528	That was over soccer results! Can you believe they gave Giggs a yellow card in the box?
1529	"Homer, we'd like to talk to you."
1530	"I'm going to take a bathiola. When I come back, you'd better be laughing."
1531	"Oh, you should be ashamed! Your father works very hard to put lobsters on our table. Every night, he comes home exhausted, with his voice too hoarse to talk."
1532	Mmmaybe a little morphine would refresh my memory.
1533	Fox flew me out here to bring you back. They flew me on Frito Lay's Air Force Yum!
1534	I won't get what I really want
1535	Ooh! We mock your very decency.
1536	We'll be the laughingstock of the whole town!
1537	"Meditations on turning eight, by Lisa Simpson. I had a cat named Snowball -- She died, she died! Mom said she was sleeping -- She lied, she lied! Why oh why is my cat dead? Couldn't that Chrysler hit me, instead? I had a hamster named Snuffy -- He died, --"
1538	A new washing machine? No way!
1539	And you have to promise no diddilies or doodilies.
1540	"Oh, she'll win the contest, but she'll lose her soul."
1541	Bart! How do you know these things?
1542	"Uh, Dad, that's his crotch."
1543	"Watch out, Radioactive Man!!!!!"
1544	Wow! Is that your space name?
1545	"Hey, it's Krusty. I need you to get me out of another jam."
1546	"Oh my God, you're right. I spelled it wrong. I tried my best -- and I failed!"
1547	"Bart, that was your cherished childhood toy."
1548	It's just Flanders. You know him.
1549	"Now, what do we say when we get to the ticket booth?"
1550	"Welcome to your room, Mom. I want you to stay here forever."
1551	"I'll get a second job. One that pays well. You think those guys on ""Friends"" need another friend?"
1552	Grampa's the name. Did you know this tree dates back to frontier times?
1553	Must jettison excess weight!
1554	"Off with their heads! said the Red Queen. Now, pull the tab."
1555	She doesn't want to end up like me?!
1556	We can't just give up our home. There's gotta be a way to get those guys out of there.
1557	"Marge, meet pro football's newest team: the Springfield Meltdowns!"
1558	"Dead, dead, dead, dead..."
1559	I'm too... important.
1560	"Oh, lemme go with you, Dad!"
1561	"Gee, I'm sorry mister."
1562	I think we should go see our mortgage broker.
1563	The Michael Jackson? No way!
1564	Your mother was living with her two wicked sisters.
1565	"So, I'm watchin' TV today..."
1566	"Yeah, you can't have any fun in bed."
1567	"If Dad ever reads that book, he's gonna be so humiliated."
1568	Journalistic dynamite.
1569	I was jealous of Neil Armstrong!
1570	I got a B in arithmetic.
1571	"All right now, let's get this carcass over to the hospital and carve it up for organs."
1572	Will you take us to Mt. Splashmore?
1573	How would you know? Your backhand looks like a rusty gate.
1574	"Hey everybody, I'm Peter Pantsless!"
1575	"But I ask you, who does smoking actually hurt, except the smokers, those around them, and the unborn children of the pregnant women we let in free on Expectant Mothers drink free night?"
1576	You should know. It is your favorite album.
1577	Which one of you do-hickeys is the tea kettle?
1578	"Okay, Dan. Fire away."
1579	This play has everything!
1580	"Well, Homer. There seems to be a lot of good obedience schools here."
1581	"Well, sink your crooked rotting teeth into this!"
1582	Ah-ah-ah! Now here's your biggest problem of all...
1583	I'll pay you forty dollars if you think of it for me.
1584	"I kinda figured this might happen, so I built the shelter big enough for both our families."
1585	Where are the refreshments?
1586	We have a free hotel room in Miami for two days?
1587	Good. Can you play with him for half an hour?
1588	Yes! That's what I wanted!
1589	I won't shed a tear when the oceans rise and wash this world away.
1590	Shot? By you? I'm afraid not my primitive friend. Your kind has neither the cranial capacity nor the opposable digits to operate a firearm. The one who shot me was...
1591	"Oh, it's not your fault, honey. I'm supposed to be the responsible one. I shouldn't have let you let me get carried away."
1592	"Oh, don't congratulate me, congratulate Bay State Fish Sticks... as my advisor, you're entitled to ten percent of the proceeds."
1593	"You just answered your own question with that commode mouth. Besides, you kids need to learn morals and decency, and how to love your fellow man."
1594	Whaddaya think? Do you love it?
1595	"Lisa, why aren't you smiling with us?"
1596	"Hey, Ralph. You're braver than you thought."
1597	"Aunt Selma, this may be presumptuous, but have you ever considered artificial insemination?"
1598	"Yeah, they're Italian."
1599	"Hey, my dad may have gained a little weight, but he's not some kind of food-crazed maniac."
1600	"So, how's the TV reception here? Excellent, or...?"
1601	If we formed a club we could serve drinks.
1602	It's church. You have to go.
1603	"Um, can I just have a slice?"
1604	Good. Does anyone else have a love story?
1605	"Grampa, I made your favorite dinner -- teething biscuits soaked in buttermilk."
1606	Execute the cameraman!
1607	"Dad, do you think I'm ugly?"
1608	Not again! Ow! Let's try 'em together.
1609	"Sure is! That's why after Homer accidentally killed Edna, I married Maude's ghost!"
1610	"Dad, Willie got arrested 'cause of us!"
1611	Black Hawk down! Black Hawk down!
1612	Johnson's Water Seal.
1613	"Hang onto it, Toy-Boy! You might need it when it starts raining naked ladies!"
1614	"Sir, the designers are here with some prototypes for your casino."
1615	I'm gonna do a little research.
1616	Yeah. Wiggum couldn't catch cooties at Milhouse's birthday party.
1617	"Honey, what you're feeling is called ""empathy."""
1618	"Well, thank you for a lovely time."
1619	He says shows set during World War One are too sad. Particularly how everyone's always climbing stairs.
1620	My hair isn't really blue.
1621	"These fortunes are terrible. They're supposed to predict stuff, and ease you through times of doubt and sickness."
1622	"Now let's remember: no one's right, and no one's wrong, till I say so."
1623	This one's gonna be the Simpsons at our finest.
1624	"Yeah, I knew we wouldn't win."
1625	For the first time I actually had to do my job.
1626	Now for operation strike-make-go-longer.
1627	"Hey, they can't just build a parking lot on Saber Tooth Meadow. That's where they discovered all those fossils!"
1628	"Oh, look at that, a shoe box house. Lisa, you're so clever."
1629	Just... my bones... and organs...
1630	"You are not pretending to be dead, young lady. This family has had nothing but bad luck when it comes to farce."
1631	"Hm. Clean dishes. I either have to unload them, or, uh..."
1632	"Y'know something, Bart? I'm getting tired of things like that."
1633	"No, no, no, no. I got a lot goin' on."
1634	...but you always looked out for me.
1635	Help! Help! I fell down the well.
1636	Homer no. You'll kill us all.
1637	"We can discuss it later. Right now, while you're here, you can help host my book club."
1638	"I won't say, but his initials are S.F."
1639	ABOUT A MILLION GIRLS.
1640	"Marge needs help, and God knows, I'm not the man to provide it. But I know who can..."
1641	"We can't afford Christmas. And when you can't afford Christmas, you've failed as a family. That's what all the big stores say."
1642	"They need our support. Besides, they gave me two tickets to the ballet."
1643	"Since I got demoted I have to show my I.D., but the picture was taken so long ago I put on a lot of weight, so I have to stretch out my face and say ""I used to look like this..."""
1644	And some dip for these chips... somethin'.
1645	"Oh, absolutely, Ned. Sorry."
1646	"But Mr. Burns, it's not my bear. It's Maggie's."
1647	"I got a mink shammy, sir. I hope that... Oh my god, Mr. Burns is dead! Why do the good always die so young?!"
1648	He's heading into Dead Man's Curve!
1649	"Ow, that sting hurt so much. We gotta get outta this, Ned."
1650	"Listen, I'm real sorry I busted your shack. Let me make it up to you. I know a ravine where there's a rusted-out car."
1651	Here we sit enjoying the shade.
1652	"Send someone right over! Ooh, here he is."
1653	"And Lisa, what have you learned?"
1654	"Just the radio, dear."
1655	"Marge, I'm going to Moe's. Send the kids to the neighbors, I'm comin' back loaded."
1656	"Dad, the arena's in Olde Springfield."
1657	What are you doing in my corpse-hatch?
1658	I'm afraid you just made things even worse.
1659	"Manjula, we've got a special guest for you."
1660	"Whoa, that's BeyoncÃ© volume."
1661	Eat my short stories!
1662	It's hard to miss the cameras.
1663	That's because there were seven apostles.
1664	"Hmm, still warm. They can't be far."
1665	"Yes! Losers! Lo-sers! Lo-sers! L-- You said ""Homer,"" right?"
1666	Blocked Number? That service is three sixty-five a month! Did you switch places with a millionaire kid who looks just like you?
1667	I never liked that Dr. Stupid.
1668	I don't know. It's a lot of pressure. Do many people watch the Super Bowl?
1669	Mild-mild-mild-mild-mild!
1670	...but I am severely tempted to do it over this.
1671	"I used to love Springfield Park, but it's gotten so run down."
1672	On a night like tonight I have to believe there are.
1673	"Oh, poor Johnny Stabbo..."
1674	"Oh, nothin'. Forget it."
1675	"After seeing how happy you were with Horatio Homewrecker, I made a decision."
1676	Hm. Usually that ends the dream.
1677	"Stupid Italy... wish you'd never been unified by Victor Emmanuel the Second... if only you'd stayed a loose confederation of city-states, trading with each other and occasionally warring."
1678	They said their insurance won't cover you.
1679	"Whoa, slow down. I never go to ""second entendre"" on the first date."
1680	That's funny. 'Cause this is how I got the job the first time.
1681	"Bart, why is your mom riding a two-person bike by herself?"
1682	"No, really. You're lazy and self-righteous..."
1683	You wouldn't want what he's eating. It's mostly just snouts and entrails.
1684	"Mr. Hutz, this is hardly the time or place to discuss this."
1685	What the?! Then I wanna eat at Moe's Express!
1686	"We tried giving them eggnog at Christmas, but it led to widespread de-shawling."
1687	Aren't you tired of having to peel that last snotty Kleenex from the bottom of your wastebasket?
1688	"Lisa, lots of times two incompatible things can both be true. My son's a brat but he's a special little guy. Your father says he's at work, but there he is jumping on a trampoline."
1689	Get away from that thing and help me find my athletic equipment.
1690	"Mom, are you sure you don't want to discuss it?"
1691	Isn't this the busy season? Where is everybody?
1692	"Well, why the hell am I down here?"
1693	"Lis, have I told you lately that I love you?"
1694	"Moe, I need your advice."
1695	"Man, this place looks expensive. I feel like I'm wasting a fortune just standing here. Better make the most of it."
1696	"Marge, don't flake out on me. That monkey's paw is gonna make our dreams come true."
1697	"If every student pledges not to cheat, and to turn in any cheater, no one will cheat the system because they'll be the system."
1698	He's betrothed to Martha Take-a-punch.
1699	"Keep her away from me, Marge! She's got that crazy look in her eyes again."
1700	"No kidding? Hey, speaking of achievers, they're thinking of spraying your old man's work space for ticks."
1701	"Son, I just want you to know, whatever that judge decides, I'm gonna be the best dad I can."
1702	"Mr. Cowell, would you like some band candy?"
1703	"He's called ""The Bachelor."""
1704	"Hey, it's Dad! Right on time!"
1705	And don't take candy from strangers.
1706	Where is it? My wedding dress!
1707	You cost me my only friends! You ruined my life!
1708	Here are your lunches. And no trading your fruit for firecrackers.
1709	You make me feel like dancing...
1710	"Bye Bart! I love you, Lisa! Sleep tight, Maggie! Today's the last day you can eat the yogurt in the fridge!"
1711	"Looks like. Juliet, I don't want to go to Equalia anymore."
1712	"Hey, um, you gonna be okay?"
1713	That's not fair... Why is Bart getting a present and I'm getting chewed out?
1714	"Once you get used to the druggings, this isn't a bad place."
1715	"Lisa, people these days don't want to see a baby bird. They want to see celebrities at their worst."
1716	"Don't be too loud and don't be too quiet. When you're too quiet, you get that psycho look."
1717	Get back in. It's only funny with a small car.
1718	What? It goes right by our house.
1719	"Uh, then maybe you better not look at me."
1720	"Don't worry, we're safe. He's two steps away and one to the right."
1721	What's this lunchbox made of?
1722	"I've discovered a mystery, wrapped in a riddle in the basement of a lousy school!"
1723	We want a pitcher / Not a belly itcher!
1724	Mr. Burns! Where's Mr. Smithers?
1725	The one who shot me was...
1726	That cost me 35 cents!
1727	Bring on the rappin' granny!
1728	But I can't. I already asked somebody.
1729	From now I will speak out against the evils in society from dog napping to cigarettes.
1730	Homer! Are you actually giving up your faith?
1731	"Well Marge, we solved the case of the haunted quarry."
1732	"Well, not the Unitarians. If that's the one true faith, I'll eat my hat."
1733	"Cleaning graffiti off a statue makes a mockery of everything I stand for. I don't think I can survive here, Lis."
1734	"Hmm, I keep thinking I'm forgetting something."
1735	"Fools! You poor, pathetic, misguided creatures, choking down your Flaming Moe's. All the time wondering, ""How does he do it?"" Well, I'm going tell you. The secret ingredient is..."
1736	Failed to separate your bottles and newspapers.
1737	"Ay caramba, que mujer tonta! Veinte horas estudiar por nada!"
1738	You have to understand -- Ray doesn't exist.
1739	"No, no, no, no, no, no -- I don't want the money back, I just came for my dog."
1740	My God! It's nothing but carrots and peyote.
1741	Let me say I was the first clown to put a woman in sketches. Miss Bada Boom Boom Boom! She had more acting talent in one boob than most women have in their entire rack.
1742	Who wants ginger snaps?
1743	Thirty-one plus forty-three.
1744	I wonder where all the kids are.
1745	I won't say anything controversial.
1746	Lousy Saint Louis Cardinals. Can't win the nineteen eighty-five World Series on Classic Sports.
1747	Why couldn't he give up this like he gives up everything else?
1748	"I thought I'd be jumping for joy the day Skinner left, but now all I have is this weird hot feeling in the back of my head."
1749	Good riddance. Their drawings suck and they look like hippies.
1750	"Catchy song, all right. You really wrote it?"
1751	Paddles down! It's the only way to change the system!
1752	"Back in nineteen forty-four, I was stationed over there and I met a beautiful girl..."
1753	Why are we really waiting for Dad?
1754	We were learning to use all thirty-three forks.
1755	And we've got front row seats!
1756	Tell him it'll count towards his community service.
1757	"Sweetie, I can't abandon my route even for one day. If those kids discover the link between eating right and feeling good, I am screwed. But I'll be back in time for your show."
1758	"Boy, get down from there!"
1759	Who cares what we look like in whatever stupid year this is?
1760	"Wow, he's even more agitated than usual. Maybe we should let him stay."
1761	"Jeepers, that's sugary, even for my taste."
1762	That's why he had to go away forever.
1763	Aha! No one's around. The perfect crime.
1764	"Hey Krusty, Krusty, remember the time we got loaded and set those beavers loose in that pine furniture store? Memories. All right, you take it easy, Krusty."
1765	"Yeah, but it's just pretend violence, which is actually beneficial for children."
1766	"Oh, it's no fair. We'll never have a buffer."
1767	"Great debut, son. You really settled in after some early jitters."
1768	But it can't be an angel!
1769	"Actually, I've been hit by the unfair labor practices bug."
1770	"Oh, sure thing, Moe. I was just using it as a coaster."
1771	The thing is no one was hurt. I think it would be really silly to dwell on this.
1772	"Okay, sweetie. Daddy'll take over."
1773	"Excuse me, sir. I can't find my children."
1774	Do you give 'em out for fans? 'Cause I'm a fan.
1775	"Not anymore. Ladies, say hello to..."
1776	I figured a good time to pick you up was when they were at Lisa's recital.
1777	"Dad, that will never work. If you want to make your move, you've gotta play it... cool."
1778	"That teddy bear survived three safety recalls, but it couldn't survive you!"
1779	"Oh Homie, I'm so proud of you. You stood up for people's right to express love in its most perfect form, a binding legal contract."
1780	In English class I did the best.
1781	"Doc, this is all too much. I mean, my son a genius -- how does it happen?"
1782	"Sweetie, you shouldn't have to worry about such things."
1783	Fine. Keep 'em. But you have to give back... Lisa?!
1784	I'll be anything and everything you want! Don't leave me here with them!
1785	Yay! The Simpsons are going to Japan!
1786	Miss... Miss! Do you have a Chanel suit or any other high-quality clothes?
1787	Prohibition! They tried that in the movies and it didn't work. I predict this is the last we'll be hearing about prohibition.
1788	"Oh, it's so beautiful."
1789	I decorated her car for nothing.
1790	Ow! Oh! Call work and tell 'em I won't be in tomorrow.
1791	"Noble spirits, your time has passed."
1792	I'm glad I sent the kids to Grampa's to protect their innocent minds.
1793	There's no chance whatsoever. I'll show you.
1794	"Hey, show some respect. Three gingerbread workmen died making that."
1795	"You know, they look a little similar."
1796	But who'd own you then?!
1797	"Hey, it's morning, and Mom and Dad aren't home yet."
1798	"He says, there aren't any easy answers! I say, he's not looking hard enough!"
1799	"Oh, there's the little prom queen now."
1800	That my family isn't the center of my universe? Are you nuts?
1801	For the greater good.
1802	"Dad, I'm calling about the school talent show."
1803	I'm trying to teach Maggie that nature doesn't end with the barnyard. I want her to have all the advantages that I didn't have.
1804	Don't worry. Daddy'll fix it.
1805	"Look on the bright side, Dad. Did you know that the Chinese use the same word for crisis as they do for opportunity?"
1806	"Please, Homer. Can't we try it?"
1807	Take a picture first.
1808	We've never lost a year before and I'll be damned if we're gonna lose one on my shift.
1809	"Ahh, the morning horoscope. ""Today will be a day like every other day."" It just gets worse and worse."
1810	"Okay, okay. Here we go."
1811	"Hi, guys, what are you doing?"
1812	We're gonna be snore in the morning...
1813	"Hey, I created three kids, and no one's making a big deal of that."
1814	Dad... I gotta tell you something... Hope you won't be too mad...
1815	"Yeah, except their dad wasn't waiting in the car reading Archie comics."
1816	"Oh Lisa, you take the fun out of everything! I am so glad I am not your kid."
1817	This gun is filled with ketchup. This one with mustard. Now give me three hundred fifty bucks or you're gonna be a mess for your date.
1818	"Uh, could I just get a look at that?"
1819	"You know what, Dad? Maybe we'll go exploring on our own for a while."
1820	"Why the sweet talk, Apu? Are you after some cheap drugs?"
1821	"Bart, eat up or you'll be late for school!"
1822	"Well, let me sew that up for you."
1823	My mistake. Stay in the moment.
1824	"Apple, apple, apple... Come on candy bar. Hey, I know you! You're that first apple I didn't want. That sinks it. I'm really gonna let 'em have it this time!"
1825	I guess I've been in denial. Homer... Kang is Maggie's father.
1826	Let's see what's goin' on vis a vis the VISA.
1827	Really? That's wonderful. But how?
1828	"Well, I'm opposed to the whole thing! Damn opposed!"
1829	"So Lenny, ever get that rebar out of your head?"
1830	She should be ashamed!
1831	"It's to open the crate, stupid."
1832	"Dudes! Wanna make some extra spending money? Get a free pair of boots? Hey baby, you like obstacle courses?"
1833	It'll make a walk on the beach seem like a punch in the face.
1834	You know... there's a karaoke night at school tomorrow. Some of the little kids are bringing their parents. Do you wanna go?
1835	"Mom, Dad! I'm playing on a dangerous cliff -- because you're too busy arguing to pay attention to me!"
1836	"Grampa, I found your cigar box dug up in the backyard, but the gun wasn't there. Have you seen it?"
1837	Okay. I'll go get some stuff.
1838	I am not wearing this.
1839	"Yup, pretty much. Except we drove around in a van solving mysteries."
1840	Bart! I need my glasses!
1841	I'm used to buying my critters pre-made. How does your store differ?
1842	"Well, I don't know. I just naturally assumed it was some of my business."
1843	"Ooo, did I ever. And that herbal anger rinse just washed the rage right out of me."
1844	I almost died... and so did Willie.
1845	"PBS, Stephen Hawking, the fat little Dixie Chick..."
1846	I want you to be Marge.
1847	"Ishy and Wha? Uh, you must be some kind of crazy person!"
1848	Put me down! Ganesh commands you! Oh-ho-ho-ho!
1849	"It's that record club. The first nine were only a penny. Then they jacked up the price! It's not fair, it's not fair I tells ya."
1850	Or we could just resolve to be more careful with our open flames.
1851	You want to know what I think?
1852	"I knew it! I knew it because why would they have our National Grammar Rodeo in another nation?! Oh, Bart, you're going to be in sooo much trouble when--"
1853	That's odd. Where's Homer? And Bart? And Lisa? And Grampa?
1854	"Helpful hint: if you want friends, don't use words like ""conundrum."""
1855	"Well, get a last look at the beautiful ocean scenery, kids."
1856	"Ooh, algebra... I'll just do a few equations. No! No more distractions!"
1857	"They want a name, Homer, not a vague description."
1858	"Well, I'm tellin' ya, Flanders can't coach at all! Now I'm not the type to have a grudge for no reason..."
1859	I've never had such a great assistant!
1860	And maybe you'll stop overeating too!
1861	Enough bickering. I know how to settle this.
1862	"Bart, think I can ever find another one like her?"
1863	I admit Sgt. Skinner seems okay... but Mr. Tamzarian pulled himself up from the streets and earned our respect and admiration.
1864	"Wow, everything is so high-tech."
1865	"Medication time? Hot dog! Gimme, gimme, gimme!"
1866	"I don't want to be a wet blanket, but maybe you should give yourself up."
1867	"Marge, do you want this last pork chop?"
1868	My Joe isn't sloppy enough!
1869	Are you prepared to take that chance?
1870	"We should have paid more attention to these side-effects. It's all here -- erratic behavior, paranoia, diarrhea..."
1871	Mom! I found Sideshow Bob's hide-out and I got a secret message to the police and I had a blimp fall on me and I was in an atomic blast but I'm okay now!
1872	He is quite a charmer. Your father's certainly taken a shine to him...
1873	CAUTION: Exit through door seven only. All other rooms contain man-eating tigers.
1874	"Yell out ""I'll eat a booger."""
1875	"I guess now we know why they call them rapids and not slow-pids, huh?"
1876	It got rave reviews from both the Entertainment Radio Network and the Radio Entertainment Network. Let's go!
1877	"Gee, I gotta call my family."
1878	"And when you get a job interview, try not to call your employer a ""punk"" or a ""skank."""
1879	"Although if we were evil spirits, we'd probably assume the shape of your parents."
1880	"Wow, thanks, Nelson! I'll come by your house later --"
1881	"Hey Moe, you got any Fudd?"
1882	Is this thing hurting you?
1883	"I gotta hand it to Artie Ziff, Marge. That little nerd saved my life."
1884	I can't believe you stood Mom up.
1885	You're going to take DNA from these historical figures and add it to your own?
1886	"I'm having problems with my new boss Roz. She's the most evil person to come out of Ohio since LeBron, but at least he thought long and hard before screwing everybody over, in public for no reason."
1887	WILL YOU STOP THIS STUPID CRAP? / I WANNA TAKE A NAP!
1888	"I'll bet you have a lot of things planned, eh Dad?"
1889	"Yes, he's been our family physician and trusted friend ever since the day I became a mother. He's seen us through everything from colds to impetigo with competence and loving care."
1890	"Shut up, Flanders. But some things I could never take from you: your kindness, your gentle spirit..."
1891	"Okay, let's see. Oh, you can buff that out, you can buff that out, that's factory error, that thing's supposed to be on fire..."
1892	Ooh! An apron with a sonnet!
1893	"Definitely. Well, crazy about carjacking."
1894	Didn't seem like anybody even read the script.
1895	For once in my life I'm tall. Don't take that away from me.
1896	"Why are you doin' this, Bart?"
1897	"Marge, I did it! I found Lincoln's gold!"
1898	"Come on, Nessie. One more pull."
1899	"Well, I hope he's accompanied by the ""How was your day"" monster, and the ""Foot rub"" monster and the let me just..."
1900	Forget context. He's gotta be a surfer. Gimme a nice shmear of surfer.
1901	"Uh, also confiscate me a t-shirt, uh, triple-X-L."
1902	"Mom, that was incredible!"
1903	Ohh...kids have been doing that one since my day.
1904	Will you turn that engine off?
1905	"Not to worry. I believe there's another one around here, somewhere."
1906	"Marmaduke was horrible today! Also, Marge is in therapy and she didn't even tell me!"
1907	Anybody got a building permit? 'Cause we nailed it!
1908	Bart! Lisa! What are you two doing home so early?
1909	BROTHER NED'S GOT CHEESE ON BREAD / AND A SIDE ORDER OF SHAME...
1910	"Okay, that should do it, Moe."
1911	It only passed the safety panel by a three to two vote! And that third vote didn't come cheap!
1912	"There's only one thing we can do. Take advantage of the old guy. You gotta sign my report card, Dad."
1913	"But now Dad can come home, right?"
1914	Oh for God's-- now? Do you have to?
1915	I don't read the words. I just like when he punches people. How do you make his costume stick so close to his muscles?
1916	"Check it out, boy! It's like looking into a living snow mirror!"
1917	Flowers every week! I wish I was dead.
1918	Fine. I'll drink alone.
1919	"Well, I'm so glad there's a show we women can enjoy!"
1920	Say goodbye to your brother.
1921	TO FIGHT FOR KID-POWER / I MUST BE HEARD NOT SEEN / I HAVE TO LEAD WISELY / NOT JUST PRIMP AND PREEN!
1922	The shirt makes a good point.
1923	"All right, but your next story better be worth it."
1924	"Please welcome new panelist, Barney Gumbel."
1925	"Look, he's licking the slime off that rock! That's what he's been eating -- slime! And there's enough slime for all of us! We're saved!"
1926	"Hm. Wh-when you put it that way, it does seem a bit small."
1927	"But still... you're gone. Oh, where are you, boy?"
1928	"I don't mean to be disrespectful, Judge Harm, but we are not bad parents. And there isn't a tether in this world with enough fiber optics to make me say we are."
1929	"Oh, Jack. I know you hate to betray your artistic vision, but just do it."
1930	I'll miss Sheriff Lobo...
1931	Cool! It's the NBC news feed!
1932	I think it's pretty obvious that I am.
1933	Would a U.S. dollar change your mind?
1934	Can we go to bed now?
1935	Whoops! Forget what I just told you.
1936	You sure love driving.
1937	I need to know that Chalmers will be taken care of!
1938	"Attaway, son! You made your old man proud!"
1939	I understand. Yoink. Wow...
1940	You can't judge me by that sketch. It was a different time -- nineteen ninety-eight!
1941	"Well, remember this: Bart Simpson takes care of his friends."
1942	"Okay boy, this is it. Five dollars!"
1943	I switched the names on the DNA samples. Then I put my name first on the list for a new heart.
1944	Maybe you're not cut out for competitive eating.
1945	"All right Simpsons, the jig is up! We know you're in there!"
1946	"It wasn't a fair fight! Your church suckered him in with gory stories, just like we were suckered into getting Cinemax."
1947	I knew it. It was all a dream.
1948	"Mrs. Krabappel, I didn't..."
1949	"What does it look like? I'll get our letter so wet, the ink will run and no one will be able to read it."
1950	"Okay... but if Dad kisses Mom too much, a stork will lay an angel egg in her tummy, and the next thing you know we find a baby brother in the cabbage patch! Here's a thumbnail sketch:"
1951	Ninety-eight point six. You're fine.
1952	No way. I still haven't lost the weight I put on from the last one.
1953	Yes we do. It's a Johan Oldenveldt.
1954	What if we were raptured right now?
1955	What kind of a booze cruise is this? Where's the hooch?
1956	"Lisa, do you think you could check on your father?"
1957	"Look, stop calling me and start enjoying your vacation. Remember, I want to see lots of pictures when you get back."
1958	"You see?! You see?! ""I"" just left ""my"" first session and ""I"" haven't opened ""my"" mouth yet."
1959	"Oh, Flanders, I, uh, want to give you your stuff back."
1960	"I've never been so embarrassed. And the worst part is, this is brunch so you've ruined two meals! I'll see you all at lupper!"
1961	Homer! Watch your mouth!
1962	"You're a hologram, aren't you?"
1963	I wish I had bullies like you growing up.
1964	"So, the anagram spells: ""Regally, the rock gem is..."""
1965	--but she hasn't come home yet and we're worried she's in trouble!
1966	Christmas card? I haven't even taken the photo yet!
1967	"Mmm, open-faced club sand wedge..."
1968	The bass guitar? This doesn't really seem like... you.
1969	"You're the one the papers have been talking about. That mysterious ""Beer Baron"" who's been supplying Springfield with alcohol! How have you been getting away with this?"
1970	You're in. Here's the sack.
1971	"Well, Simpson, I must say, once you've been through something like that with a person, you never want to see that person again."
1972	Yay! / All right! / Woo-hoo! /
1973	"Sorry, buddy. You got me confused with Fred Flintstone."
1974	"Stop it, you two, and put on some nice clothes. Since it's just the four of us tonight, we're having dinner at the Rusty Barnacle."
1975	"Wait, you really think Marge is gonna fall for this guy? Even after I bought her that hockey-fight tape?"
1976	Cause I wanted some really bad kids to like me. Somehow I got the idea that being popular was the most important thing in the world.
1977	Haven't you learned anything from watching Bart drive?
1978	Just ask if anyone knows Ollie Tabooger.
1979	"Now honey, let's turn on the news and forget our troubles."
1980	"Now, m'lady, your carriage awaits."
1981	"Oooh, and this one's fifty percent off."
1982	I'm going back to the stadium to bring those two kids back together. And I'll do it with or without you!
1983	"That's funny, because I have recurring flash-forwards to a nightmarish future."
1984	"Look, if you tell what I did, I'll get in trouble."
1985	Do I sound like a beautiful woman?
1986	One that's made: entirely out of syrup.
1987	"Much better! Oh good, the curtains are on fire!"
1988	"Fear not, m'lady! Captain Dash Superstud is here with his small tool!"
1989	It's your fault I'm bald!
1990	"Marge, uh, maybe you should take a break from wedding planning. I think you're becoming a... Bridezilla."
1991	"Don't forget to say ""I didn't do it""."
1992	"Bart, if you had cleaned up your room when I asked you to, your father's trick back would still be aligned. So you pick up this mess right now."
1993	"One, six, seventeen, twenty-two, twenty-four, thirty-five."
1994	Why does the school need to watch us all the time?
1995	Rusty the Clown?! Springfield gets the lamest balloons.
1996	Well -- what do you think?
1997	She's brought her own orrery!
1998	"Oh. I love you, Marge."
1999	You crumb-bum. You looked me right in the eye and lied to me.
2000	Here sir! But my doctor says no more bombardment.
2001	So... I'm sure you missed Marge last night.
2002	"Thanks, Mom. Hey, where's my pony?"
2003	"Oh, it just turned up in the course of my daily rummaging. By the way, I oiled the hinge on your diary."
2004	And it's on this DVD!
2005	When I was a kid we didn't show our affection by head-butting.
2006	"Yeah, yeah, miracles are all around us. Now please, I am trying to hear the school closings."
2007	"Uh, that crease is in your leg, Sir."
2008	I wanna visit a screen door factory!
2009	"But, Mr. Largo, that's what my country's all about."
2010	"Hey, have you ever noticed that the ""Crossing the Desert"" is a lot like ""The Unblinking Eye"" and it's exactly like ""The Wreck of the Hesperus""?"
2011	Don't tread on pee! We probably have rights!
2012	And it sounds like he has big news!
2013	That doesn't sound like Homer's usual annoyed grunt.
2014	I don't know if you should teach our children advanced interrogation techniques.
2015	Me and the boys made you breakfast in bed. It's the best darn diddly way to start your first Flanders day!
2016	"Boy, dumping your kids in the forest sure gets your hands dusty."
2017	He framed Krusty. He tried to kill Aunt Selma. He rigged an election.
2018	"This is embarrassing to admit, Stig, but I hadn't even thought about gels."
2019	"Hello, ""Mr. Brown Ground"", whatcha got for me?"
2020	I think that's enough birthday fun.
2021	"Oh, so that's it. This is some kind of underwear thing."
2022	"Well, that ""nice lady"" set the cause of biological warfare back thirty years."
2023	What? You think I'm going to buy a twenty thousand dollar truck just because you make that noise?
2024	La la la la la la la la la...
2025	Object-Objection! He's not asking any questions!
2026	That poor man. Is he okay?
2027	"I don't care if his name is Bony McDork, just make the checks out to me."
2028	Never get into Heaven... took harp lessons for nothing...
2029	Oh no! I took a job on the other side of the world!
2030	Lookin' good... feel the burn...
2031	"Just lean into it. It'll be over soon, one way or another."
2032	"In time, in time. I need to speak with you in private."
2033	Who's gonna eat my homework now?
2034	"Oh, you are so cute! Yes you are! You are! I just love you."
2035	You can't prove I did it.
2036	"Okay, what's next? Adam and Steve or Madam and Eve?"
2037	But I can't afford this...
2038	"Well, it would be nice if the first thing I saw was a world at peace..."
2039	"Now let me tuck you in, fluff your pillow and sprinkle a little fairy dust to keep the monsters away. It's cinnamon! Nightie-night, sweetheart."
2040	I don't know. I feel like a kid in a candy store.
2041	"I hate shopping. I'm bored, my feet hurt, I'm too big for the choo-choo train... hmm, where's the ""husband chair?"""
2042	"Whatever you say, sweetie."
2043	He said Denver just fumbled.
2044	"Yes, there's a real think piece here about a bra sale."
2045	Wowww... No! All I need to stay focused is good old-fashioned fresh air.
2046	"Look! Grampa's a gorilla, Sideshow Mel is Spiderman, and Nelson's a raccoon..."
2047	"I'll kill you, you bloated museum of treachery."
2048	"Dad! No one cares about any of your stupid dinosaur bands! You have the worst, lamest taste in music ever!"
2049	This is people working?
2050	And the view is... beautiful... inspirational... nauseating.
2051	"Ouch. You hang in there, beautiful."
2052	"Bart! No! No! No, no! Oh no, Bart, No! Don't! Noooo!"
2053	Must... sign... policy...
2054	"These be mini-pizzas made from dragon eggs, your majesties."
2055	Just wait. We're coming to the site of our most romantic night ever!
2056	Extree! Extree! Man driving erratically throws papers out window!
2057	No one told me there was gonna be boasting.
2058	"That's good, Marge -- get all the terrible ideas out of your system."
2059	Here we go. Four-three-two...
2060	25 years old?! You're not 25 years old! This I.D. is completely fake!
2061	Did anyone stop that robber?
2062	What they don't suspect is that I'm into this.
2063	"Um... uh... So uh, Joey, is Wikipedia accurate when it says ""Walk This Way"" was inspired by ""Young Frankenstein?"""
2064	"Heyyy... Come to think of it, she did. Well, she didn't reckon with the awesome power of the chief of police."
2065	Jenny. Fifth grade girl.
2066	"A million dollars! Thanks, Bart! I owe you one."
2067	"Mom, this isn't the way home."
2068	So many previews. So many previews. So many previews.
2069	Tumi? But you're from the other second grade. We only come together for tornado drills.
2070	I thought we killed him!
2071	Well... I've been thinking. You've been really great to me... but there's probably some other kid who needs you even more.
2072	Well... of course that would be great. But I see myself making an impact... outside the home.
2073	I threw a javelin that barely missed Hitler...
2074	Oh my God. They're gonna drive right into it just to teach us men a lesson. And it's all my fault!
2075	"Would you like me to drain Simpson while he's passed out, sir?"
2076	You don't have to do this alone.
2077	I thought I was marrying a man who could play Macbeth.
2078	"Well, Lenny's reign of terror is over. Mr. Burns bought the plant back this morning, and..."
2079	That's a story for another day.
2080	Okay. May we please be excused?
2081	"Can you say ""get bent""?"
2082	I love these jesters. They're exactly what I need to forget about my first husband.
2083	You little shutterbug.
2084	"Oh my God, that's me!"
2085	What guys? I wanna see the freaks.
2086	"I think that's ""drop."""
2087	Oooh! They're having a retirement party for someone at the plant.
2088	Then just tell her you're already married.
2089	Oh my God! Mom! Thank you! I just need my...
2090	Is it me or did this house just get classy?
2091	"Doctor, I think Lisa has the mumps."
2092	See you at five on the dot. Phone kisses!
2093	Tell me what a cow says!
2094	Marge! Why does Art hate me? I never did anything to Art.
2095	No drinking in public!
2096	"I'm honoring America's advertisers. Then we're going to buy some toothpaste, lease a new car, and vote ""yes"" on Prop Eighty-Seven."
2097	"Did you see the way Emile's lookin' at Mindy? Hoo-hoo, I think something's going on there."
2098	Why Bart? I thought we were friends!
2099	That is such a girl thing to say.
2100	"The Fireworks, Candy and Puppy Dog Store?!"
2101	"Well, Homer, our kids showed us something today, huh? By working together, we can both be winners. Thank heaven neither of us has to go through with that silly wager. Put 'er there, pal."
2102	"Flimsy lead, take me away!"
2103	"All right, Nelson. What kind of journalism skills do you have?"
2104	"Oh look, Jaclyn Smith has her own line of axe heads!"
2105	"Allouetty, jaunty allouetty, allouetty... ...Hmm. Allouetty..."
2106	"Anyhoo, Bart, you're gonna have to be punished. This isn't just some sort of club house."
2107	"Uh. Yeah. That's just what it is, a bust."
2108	Ooh! Thomeone wearth a brathelet. Who'th your boyfriend? Dr. Osterberg?!
2109	"Yeah, well I still love this place."
2110	And you know what the best part is? We've really done something for the children.
2111	"Uh, did you know there's a guy outside handing out free Stridex pads?"
2112	"Then, they followed me home, begging me to take a test drive. And let me tell you, talk about roomy! The Canyonero combines the smooth handling of a European sports car with the rugged driveability of a sturdy 4X4."
2113	Rich laughing with poor...
2114	"No, of course not. The very notion of a talking banana is absurd! Still."
2115	A life well-lived. Until last night. I guess I'll have to watch that now.
2116	What's that? A home-made bat?
2117	"Whoa, you must be sick."
2118	"Yeah, the Simpson family is a long line of horse thieves, deadbeats, horse beats, dead thieves, and even a few..."
2119	Wait -- did you get my sweater out of the front seat?
2120	"Sir, we should get going."
2121	I wanted to surprise you for Christmas...
2122	"Mr. Burns, I hardly see what destroying our meager possessions is going to accomplish."
2123	"ALL RIGHT!!! Lisa, that's wonderful. If only your father was still with us... but he left for work a few minutes ago."
2124	"Don't listen to him, Duffman. For once in your life, stand up for the little guy!"
2125	Oh yeah. From my room I can hear everything.
2126	Thank God. I couldn't take another minute in this hell-hole.
2127	"Creepy? Marge, the apocalypse is coming. Maybe not tomorrow, maybe never, but it's coming... and soon."
2128	"Sorry, Marge, I can't tell ya."
2129	"Well, uh, the thing about that is, uh..."
2130	"Why, you... You made them cancel ""Platypus Man!"""
2131	They're all about smugglers.
2132	"Well, I ... Oh, let's get some worms."
2133	CH-CH-CH-CHANGES / TIME TO CHANGE THE OIL / YEAH / CHANGES / DON'T WANNA BE AN OILY MAN /
2134	Don't forget apple sauce.
2135	Hmm. That would have to be my first day of school.
2136	"That's quite an act to follow, Lisa."
2137	"And when you pushed me off the bridge, it's 'cause you knew about the party and wanted to make sure I got here."
2138	"And I've been lookin' for you, too, pal!"
2139	"Bart, I forbid you to jump over that gorge."
2140	It's the kind John Glenn eats when he's not in space.
2141	"Hey, my milk! I traded my math book for that!"
2142	How many teeth do I have?
2143	"... And thank you most of all for nuclear power, which is yet to cause a single proven fatality, at least in this country. Amen."
2144	"Dang right! Fact is, I invented kissing. It was during World War One, and they were looking for a new way to spread germs..."
2145	"Look, I let you down and I apologize. I know that doesn't make it right, but I hope you can find it in your heart to forgive me."
2146	We can't sell the house. We can't live here. What are we going to do?
2147	"Aw, those jerks. Always walking over the small businessman. Don't get me started about the government."
2148	No teacher shall be held accountable if Bart Simpson dies.
2149	Don't you ever do that to me again.
2150	"Yeah, it's great that she's got a father-figure in her life. She--hey wait, that's supposed to be me!"
2151	Now all of you go see my movie in the theater the day it opens! No bargain matinees!
2152	You could make a lot of money.
2153	Haven't you ever been fooled by a pretty face?
2154	"Yeah, I sent it to pick up Ralph. No one was using it."
2155	"C'mon, I've got a job for you."
2156	"Here, boy! Here doggie. Oh where has my little dog gone?"
2157	Dad! I figured it out! The murderer is...
2158	"Only the sour quince log, Sir."
2159	Forget about him. Let's rehearse the bottle scene!
2160	"Confound it, man! I need your throat clear and ready for perjury."
2161	"What the-- Section 1 of Article 21 of the State Constitution is amended to read: Section 1. In the year following the year in which the national census is taken under the direction of Congress at the beginning of each decade, the Legislature shall adjust the boundary lines of Congressional, State Senate and Assembly districts. Liquor... mustn't think of liquor..."
2162	"Good God, I'm at war with a little girl... and I'm losing!"
2163	Bart! Quit fooling around and eat your dinner.
2164	"Dad, we've never been too close, have we?"
2165	"So then Lenny says, ""As if! Don't even go there, sister."""
2166	"Aw, come on, Moe. Think of all you have to offer besides money."
2167	"Don't worry, music theory's just a fancy word for music math."
2168	"Aw, all these new superheroes suck. None of them can hold a candle to Radioactive Man."
2169	"Generation X may be shallow, but at least they have tolerance and respect for all people."
2170	Buck McCoy? He was the greatest of them all. He was bigger than opium!
2171	"Joe's Crematorium. You kill 'em, we grill 'em."
2172	Like getting Washington's birthday and Lincoln's birthday back as separate paid holidays. President's Day! Pfft. What a rip-off! I bust my butt day in and day out --
2173	Well I'm glad you're not upset. All my extra credit points are like frequent flyer miles on a bankrupt airline.
2174	"Oh, honey, don't panic. If you just made a few lifestyle changes..."
2175	"Eh, this might take awhile, kid. Why don't you and your buddy run along?"
2176	"Marge, name one successful person who ever lived without air conditioning."
2177	That's your problem. You're living up here.
2178	You guys will be the hit of cousin Valerie's wedding reception!
2179	"Oh, Bart and Lisa! You remember your father, Apu. Well, this is your father, Apu's mother."
2180	"Maude, these new finger-razors make hedge trimming as fun as sitting through church."
2181	"Don't go, Zelda! I love you!"
2182	"Bloop, bloop, bloop. Bloop, bloop, bloop."
2183	"This is Red Barclay's shipment. On time, as always."
2184	"Great. Before anything else, let me just get closer to the door and say ""how crazy are you""?"
2185	"Give him one of your famous murmurs, Marge."
2186	Hey! Don't Borgnine my sandwich.
2187	Woo hoo! We're Region One! We're Region One!
2188	"W-well... It's a v-very generous offer, sir. But... his medical bills alone..."
2189	"All right, boys. Set your nightsticks on ""whomp."""
2190	"For cryin' out loud, Eddie. You scared the hell out of me!"
2191	"No, that's the rat poison!"
2192	I've got a weekend job helping the poor. And I'm only eight.
2193	"Or, if not then, Christmas."
2194	What the hell is the Southern Hemisphere?
2195	Wait a minute! This has oats in it!
2196	"So, you guys have any videogames?"
2197	"And what if we don't, Pops?"
2198	"Excuse me, ma'am, have you seen this girl?"
2199	"Yeah, well, it serves you right for eavesdropping."
2200	Uh-huh. Floor feels a little gritty here.
2201	"Yo, teachwads! The Brotherhood of the Spectacles has taken over the school!"
2202	I didn't say anything. So naÃ¯ve.
2203	"Hey, I like art, okay?"
2204	"Bart, Grampa's a kindly old man who trusts us. Are you sure it's right to take advantage of him?"
2205	"I may have lost my memory, but I'm not an idiot."
2206	Come on! Why won't you go out with Bart?
2207	"Hey, Mom. What're doing?/We were watching that!"
2208	We can have the reception at Wong Lee's!
2209	"Well, I just had a whopper! What if you got revenge on Krabappel for me, and I got revenge on Hoover for you? Crisscross!"
2210	"Yes, everyone loves rules..."
2211	"Well, where should we go for brunch?"
2212	He was right under my nose the whole time. He lives in my retirement home. His name is Molloy.
2213	"Hey, Moe, can I look too?"
2214	"Okay... I see your point. We should sell the painting, keep all the money, and never, ever tell the Van Houtens."
2215	I can finally compost!
2216	"And don't worry, all the laundry and dirty dishes'll be there when you get back."
2217	"Well uh, you look pretty successful."
2218	I can't wait till I get good.
2219	"Hey, Homer! Care to try some of my Flanders Planters punch?"
2220	His life was an unbridled success until he found out he was a Simpson.
2221	"Charles, please -- your son might see this."
2222	"Well, that was a great night for us all."
2223	When did I agree to that?
2224	"Hey, Homer! This little thing-a-ma-jig really works great. Now that I've saved the earth, maybe I oughtta spruce up the ol' homestead."
2225	I'd give anything to hear Homer's voice.
2226	I denounce thee! I denounce thee! I denounce thee!
2227	"Honestly, it wouldn't bother me."
2228	"Hey, these aren't my pills."
2229	I'll get to work. But first I have to say goodbye to some friends.
2230	"I'll bet you want a piece of me. Well, you ain't gonna get it, see! Ha, ha, ha..."
2231	There comes a time to beat the crap out of childish things!
2232	Advice? Just call me Ann Flanders!
2233	"Fine, I'll do it. Where do you want me?"
2234	"Marge, can't we get some clear plates? I can't see the TV."
2235	"Okay, let me take figure skating."
2236	"It's 6:45 A.M. next Wednesday. You may also be interested to know that it's summer here, not winter."
2237	That's not gonna protect us from anything.
2238	Huh? / You knew about the coins? / The coins are down here? / ETC.
2239	So what time does this play start?
2240	"So, surfing is really your job?"
2241	"He's the bad boy of racing. He's got attitude and bad-itude, so show him some latitude and you'll win his gratitude. Only in America!"
2242	But Reverend... Scriptural scholars disagree on the significance for Christians of many of the Old Testament's proscriptions.
2243	"Ha, ha! Eat my food! Drink up my drink! Put your coat on my daughter's bed! I command you!"
2244	I've had this dream before.
2245	"C'mon, kids, I went too far."
2246	I know this obsession with thinness is unhealthy and anti-feminist... but that's what a fat girl would say!
2247	It doesn't look like Napoleon's hat.
2248	"Great. Now, let me think... the food was... not undelicious..."
2249	"Ah, McGarnigal. Eases the pain."
2250	"Milhouse. Milhouse, wake up. Quick, look out the window."
2251	You kids must be so happy. Your cute little cartoon friends are back on the air.
2252	Sorry I'm late! I was just gathering my counseling equipment.
2253	"I'm not done yet, Marge. What's that word you use for when you and I... you know..."
2254	I was gonna put buttresses in.
2255	"Well, why did this have to happen now, during primetime, when TV's brightest stars come out to shine!?"
2256	"Flanders, pull over! I'm an ambulance!"
2257	"Well, I agree you blow."
2258	"I really need to concentrate on this, Lisa, would you mind--"
2259	"Oh, I'm sorry, that means I threw yours out. But I still have a couple of your mini carrots."
2260	This is a bad sign. I've been to classier gas stations.
2261	"Come on, Bart, your mother's only trying to help. So go ahead and enjoy the show."
2262	"Oh, right. Dad was Colonel Homer and he wore that awesome suit and Lurleen wanted to bunk his brains out! But I forget how Mom felt about it..."
2263	J -- Just the product you need. E -- Excellent value. R -- Retailer's dream. K--
2264	"Whoa, excellent haul!"
2265	"I do! I do! Wait, no I don't."
2266	I'll field that one. Me and the boys were all celebrating a job well done when I threw my match in the vicinity of the crime scene.
2267	"Well yeah, like when you look at ""Friday The 13th, Part I,"" it's pretty tame by today's standards."
2268	"I've made the calls. I'm going to have Elon Musk killed. And I'll give you a little extra morphine, friend."
2269	"That doesn't seem fair -- they won't let him escape, then they kick him out. I wonder where he'll go."
2270	Ugh. My mouth tastes like an ashtray.
2271	Please . Stop it. What's going... Who are you people?
2272	I'm tired of being a wannabe league bowler. I wannabe a league bowler.
2273	I can't take it anymore!
2274	Do you have a donut or not?
2275	No. I'm talking about your breakfast.
2276	"Wow, I gotta start going to church."
2277	Not anymore! I already put my posters up!
2278	To drink until there's no pain left in my soul. But first I'm gonna eat off someone else's room service tray that was left in the hall!
2279	I believe that every Jew should make a pilgrimage to Israel before he dies.
2280	"Oh yeah, that was a pretty addictive video game."
2281	We did twenty takes and that was the best one.
2282	"Oh Marge, your tentacles feel so good. Wait a minute... why am I getting words in edgewise?"
2283	I need to go to the bathroom.
2284	"We are rubber, you are glue."
2285	Oh yeah? Well what's up with your brother and sister?
2286	CALF'S IN THE FIELD SO YOU SNEAK UP SLOW / GRAB 'IM BY THE TAIL AND GO MAN GO...
2287	He didn't blow his line! Sarah! Let's have another!
2288	If I can keep down Arby's I can keep down you!
2289	"Smithers, what are you doing up here?"
2290	"Yeah, but they're all girls!"
2291	"I don't enjoy it. Being a father is just a job. Long hours, no pay, and at the end, all you get is someone yelling ""you screwed me up""!"
2292	You're a good father.
2293	Stupid mongoose! get the snake! The snake! Do I look like a snake? Ow! Ow! He bit me Show's over! Show's over! Next show is eight o'clock and ten!
2294	Then run along you little scamp. A boy without mischief is like a bowling ball without a liquid center.
2295	Maybe Marge would forgive me if I won the lotto. Give me a scratcher.
2296	When the hell are we gonna get to... where the hell are we going?
2297	"Wel-diddly-elcome Simpsons. Oh, geez. He actually wrote ""diddly."""
2298	Can't let Lisa lose her sense of wonder.
2299	"They just leave the maple syrup on the table, huh? How about that? That's trust, huh?"
2300	"Homie, snagging a pro football franchise is a big project, requiring a lot of follow-through..."
2301	"Oh Bart, you could use some new underwear too."
2302	I just found out I'm not Jewish. I was turned down by all those country clubs for nothing.
2303	"You know Lisa, I've taken a lot from this country. Maybe it's time I gave something back."
2304	You mean I shaved my bikini zone for nothing?!
2305	Woo hoo! Stop the presses!
2306	"My stupid sister's taken the fun out of baseball. What happened to stealing bases, the suicide squeeze, throwin' a little chin music?"
2307	"Nah, I'm really more of a slacker."
2308	"Mom, Bart was taking a picture of his butt."
2309	"Um... I-I think a woman came up with nylon stockings. I mean, probably. We certainly use them."
2310	Why? What's wrong with it?
2311	"Homie, I accept your apology."
2312	Or take the same limo.
2313	"What do you think, Homer? Does this make my hips look big?"
2314	Nobody tells Bart Simpson what to do.
2315	So it's a choice between Disneyworld and Knoxville.
2316	The last day of school. Field Day. WhEN you learn to balance an egg on a spoon...
2317	You don't want to be here.
2318	"Now, let's see what Marge is up to. ""Recipes,"" ""dress patterns,"" ""toaster undercoating agreement""... ""Heist plans""!"
2319	Yes. We'll send the eye.
2320	"No one knows better than me that it's ""here today, gone tomorrow."" But I'm here today! Thanks to you, honey."
2321	SNOW WHITE TEETH AND LIPS SO RED / SHE'S THE WILMA TO MY FRED
2322	"Initial there, and... Never!"
2323	Hmmmm. How could anyone make a word out of these lousy letters?
2324	"Dad, I gave you a list!"
2325	"I miss you guys so much. The smell of Marge's pork chops... the way you kids kiss my ""owies"" when I go boom... This place has become like a prison to me!"
2326	"Well, who knew you were such a rebel? Now, let's learn more about my wife's secret life. Secrets which can only be good."
2327	"You got it, tootsie pop."
2328	"Good evening, adults."
2329	"Excuse me, Lou. I'm supposed to say that. Acting like the chief doesn't make you the chief."
2330	"Look Pop, I'm planning some expert home repairs, and I need a pair of bolt cutters, or wire cutters, or something to get the lock off my toolbox."
2331	Now you're getting creepy.
2332	"Congratulations on your purchase of a FootMaster brand soccer ball. Thanks, book!"
2333	"Mr. Simpson, are you listening?"
2334	"It's the sound of a go-getter at work, Marge. Look, I installed a key hook so you'll always know where your keys are."
2335	And run with your leg tied to someone who wouldn't talk to you all year.
2336	Thank you! Come again!
2337	"Well, maybe he just doesn't like fist-bumping."
2338	"I just thought if we got together we could change the channel from ""The Feud Network"" to ""Comity Central."""
2339	"Only the coolest kid ever could think of that! Good golly, Sven-Golly! You did it!"
2340	That's it! We're getting you off the meds!
2341	"Well, Marge isn't here. She had to identify a body at the morgue."
2342	"Listen Martin, right now I'm looking for a friend who won't leave me for a girl."
2343	"You fool! Can't you see it's a massive government conspiracy? Or have they gotten to you, too?"
2344	"Well sure there is... ... but it involves being a bit underhanded, a bit devious, a bit, as the French say, ""Bartesque."""
2345	"Jeez, Louise. Look at this mess."
2346	Let's just take it easy.
2347	"Because after all, education is the search for truth..."
2348	I don't want people to know my kids go to this lousy school.
2349	"Neighbor, I heard about your heresy and we've made it our mission to win you back to the flock."
2350	"Ay carumba. So, what else ya got?"
2351	"No, I want to do the crossword puzzle."
2352	You should've seen the look on Krabappel's face!
2353	It should be Gary Oldman!
2354	Let me freshen that up for ya.
2355	"Look, we're just gonna take our mattress, do a quick sweep of the medicine chest, then we're outta here."
2356	"Just trying to fill the void of random, meaningless destruction that Bart's absence has left in our hearts."
2357	We don't have an outhouse.
2358	"Homer, I don't want guns in my house! Don't you remember when Maggie shot Mr. Burns?"
2359	Wha'd you say? I can't understand you with all that distortion.
2360	"Hello, Mr... Kurns? I bad want... money now. Me sick."
2361	Sorry sorry sorry sorry sorry sorry...
2362	If I want to resume fracking...
2363	So Bart couldn't've taken the eggs. I was with him the whole weekend.
2364	"Honey, do me a favor. Fill out this form."
2365	We may be the best parents in the world.
2366	"Cymbals... snare... high hat... tom-tom... sticks, mallet and brushes... this is a drum kit!"
2367	"Stop it, both of you. Grampa smells like a regular old man, which is more like a hallway in a hospital."
2368	"Listen: ""April 20th, 1860. A week ago, I had no idea what the future would bring, which, I guess, is always true of everyone all the time. Anyway, last Saturday night, I went to Colonel Burns's ball..."""
2369	Then what are you complaining about? You got yours. Mm-hm-hm.
2370	"Well, I wouldn't call it a bet. It's a little thing Daddies do to make football more exciting."
2371	"I won't let you down. Well, I might let you down on Silly Sailor."
2372	"Dad, neither of us wanna go. Why are you doing this? Where's the old carefree Homer who likes to cut loose?"
2373	"Well, we'll see about that."
2374	"Son, there comes a time in every father's life when he must -- GAAHHH!!"
2375	"So, how was it in the slammer?"
2376	"Mom, how could you do this to me?"
2377	The defense has just one more question.
2378	Hot ziggity zam! That's good enough for me!
2379	"Dad, I admit I have some problems, but drugs aren't the answer."
2380	You get the same results with a mincing gel.
2381	"Well boy, if there was ever a good time for you to find out where babies come from, in the grossest way possible, with your life on the line, this is it."
2382	I want the whole world to hear the story of my harrowing struggle with hypohemia.
2383	How can ya have a house without a gun? What if a bear came through the door?
2384	"You people are guests in our country, and the beaver have no right to treat you that way. If I get back your land, will you promise to build a casino on it?"
2385	"Yes, well it's a special evening. And I thought it best not to look like a monkey."
2386	Show's over! Whoo! That turned ultra-steamy in a jiff!
2387	Let's just say the stories about him are greatly exaggerated.
2388	"Thanks, Mom. But I told you, I'm not going."
2389	A stupid alcoholic hippo!
2390	"No, no. The person who's always standing and walking."
2391	"Sorry man, it's still too soon."
2392	"There must be something else. Think Marge, think. Culture... vulture... birds of prey... pray in a church... the father, son and Holy Ghost... ghosts are scary, scary rhymes with Gehry! That's it -- Architect Frank Gehry! He could build us a concert hall like he did in Los Angeles."
2393	We know that. W-Where has it gone to?
2394	"One Turbo Diary, please."
2395	"Don't worry, Marge. I swear to you I'll put my best man on it."
2396	"From now on we use regular toilet paper, not that fancy quilted kind..."
2397	Wait! I can't call Marge. It's our last day on earth together. I can't drag her into this mess. I know! I'll call Barney.
2398	"First we'll buy gifts for each other. Then we'll spend the rest of the cash on a Christmas tree so large, its absence from the forest will cause mudslides and flooding."
2399	I think I swallowed a toothpick.
2400	/ Help us. / We're diseased.
2401	"Well, if you won't think of society's ills..."
2402	"C'mon, Dad. I gotta go to the bathroom."
2403	"Oh boy, am I beat! If you wanna return a melon to the grocery store, clear your day!"
2404	Krusty's gone nuts...
2405	You know how I feel about hoaxes!
2406	I always keep one near the bed for you.
2407	Wait... wait a minute... wait. You're the guy who owns the nuclear power plant.
2408	Homer just pirated a movie. It's not the worst thing Dad ever did. It's not even the worst kind of pirate Dad's ever been.
2409	And Lisa will get a friend.
2410	"...As the circulation returns, the subject prepares for a long and painful recovery."
2411	Greatest generation to the rescue!
2412	"Nothing. Like many women, I still have an unhealthy obsession with my weight."
2413	"C'mon, slice, dice, and serve on rice."
2414	"Okay, I'll go quietly."
2415	"Bart, that is a new low."
2416	What are they doing with our forty-five cents?
2417	What are you kids playing?
2418	And what's that hitchhiker doing here? Is every drifter we meet going to move in with us?
2419	"You're welcome. And now Marge, we cooked, you clean."
2420	He hands a greeting card to Ned.
2421	I love my life. I love it not. I love my life. I love it not.
2422	"I know you do, Marge. But come on, you know what our vacations are like. Those three monsters in the back seat. ""Are we there yet? Are we there yet?"" And let's face it, I'm no day at the beach either. ""Marge, can I have another sandwich? Marge, can I have another sandwich?"""
2423	"Oh, don't look so shocked."
2424	I ain't a heel no more -- I'm a good guy... and you're a baby-face.
2425	I still don't get it.
2426	Ah! Max Power! How's every little thing?
2427	"What? You never went hunting before, and you're perfectly straight!"
2428	"Look, if you just want me to forgive you --"
2429	Yeah! Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha! / Ha! Ha! All right!
2430	"You know, it's kind of ironic. These old people are being kept alive by the organs of the young people they ran over."
2431	"Moe, can you think of a way to please a woman that starts with ""f""?"
2432	I just need one great idea...
2433	Please don't say any more!
2434	"Where the hell are my keys? Who stole my keys? Come on, I'm late for work."
2435	Do you want to change your name to Homer Junior? The kids can call you Hoju!
2436	I like the beat -- play me the tune.
2437	"Yeah, I'm gonna turn off the lights now."
2438	"Boy, when you write you can let your imagination run wild. ""Temperance was doing the laundry..."""
2439	It's a movie version of a cartoon family you can see for free on TV.
2440	And what's the network?
2441	A kid's never lonely when he has baloney! Except me.
2442	I'll just wait out back until then.
2443	"Okay, I'm taking off the blindfold..."
2444	"Oooh, ""Gorilla, The Conqueror."" The granddaddy of them all."
2445	"Dad, you gotta get us out of here! Use the remote!"
2446	"Right on time. Grape soda -- shaken, not stirred."
2447	"HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO ME / HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO ME / HAPPY BIRTHDAY, OVERLOOKED MIDDLE CHILD -- HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO ME."
2448	"I have eyes, don't I?"
2449	You butchers! Give it back! Gimme that! Gim--
2450	There's only one thing left to try.
2451	And not just any man.
2452	"Oh no, he fell! I can't look!"
2453	What if we show Lisa we can sleep in her room without being frightened? Hm?
2454	"No, the ants are the farmers."
2455	"This theater sucks. My seat's uncomfortable, the screen's only half a screen, and that guy's eating an apple!"
2456	"Imbecile. Simpson, your family will have to remain here."
2457	Because I'm filled with stress!
2458	You people make me sick. You're vultures. Where were you when I sang at Farm Aid? Out of my way you parasites. I said out of my way.
2459	"What's the problem, Seymour? Stuck?"
2460	"Homer, that's not a prayer, that's gossip."
2461	"Listen, um... after our fight, I couldn't sleep."
2462	"Smithers, do you think maybe my power plant killed those ducks?"
2463	"How about, ""With a love that will echo through the ages?"""
2464	"Did you see that? You know, Marge, this is the way I've always wanted it to be. We've become a fully functioning family unit. We've always blamed ourselves, but I guess it's pretty clear which cylinder wasn't firing."
2465	"More hashbrowns, sugar?"
2466	It's Christmas! It's Christmas! It's Christmas!
2467	"Gotcha. Well, gotta go."
2468	We're not dead... and neither are you.
2469	"Mr. Fairbanks, lookin' at your boat I gotta say, Gramma bet on the wrong horse."
2470	"What's everyone's problem? I'm glad we're stranded. It'll be just like the Swiss Family Robinson, only with more cursing. We're gonna live like kings. Damn hell ass kings!"
2471	"But Moe, how can you be their leader when you're not one of them?"
2472	It all makes sense now.
2473	Please tell me I'm still beautiful!
2474	"Hello, Dean? You're a stupid head."
2475	"Uh, Mr. Burns, pirates got your yacht."
2476	"Now remember, we have to leave nature just the way we found it. Everything we pack in, we pack out."
2477	"All right, boy. This calls for the biggest punishment I've ever handed down. And this time it's gonna stick!"
2478	"Sorry, Lisa. Can't change the future."
2479	"That was the prop comedy of the Sea Captain. More like ""thar he blows""."
2480	We... I... You come up with an excuse!
2481	Area 51? I found Area 51!
2482	"Yeah, yeah, great. I guess my getting-up days are over."
2483	A shirt from that rap concert... Bart must've gone to the show. But that means...
2484	Now who has ideas for this year's fundraiser?
2485	"Well, maybe the animals don't mind, honey. They might enjoy being the center of attention."
2486	"Smithers, you could learn a thing or two from this braying moron. Young man, I'm making you my executive vice president."
2487	So maybe a part-time job is the answer.
2488	"Looks more like ""Brad Storch""."
2489	I don't want your pity.
2490	I think that means six more weeks of Autumn.
2491	Those are just Reese's Pieces.
2492	Can we call you Uncle Blackie?
2493	They have jellies made of fruits I've never heard of!
2494	"And I have a special present for you, but I'll give it to you later tonight."
2495	Shouldn't you be at work right now?
2496	"That's ridiculous. Who's your daddy, Maggie? Who's your daddy?"
2497	Look! Shiny keys! Jingle jangle!
2498	"Deformed? Why didn't you say so? They should call this book ""Johnny Deformed!"""
2499	Opera? They have that here too?
2500	Wait-wait-wait-wait-wait. There's an easy way to get rid of Chester without the guilt of sending him back to the gutter.
2501	Bongo?! I told you never to ever talk about Bongo!
2502	Get your hands off my husband!
2503	"Well, it's still fun to be up late."
2504	I can bench twice as much as when I started! And look at my abs!
2505	"Well, my best recollection of Burns' paraphrasing of what he read in Moe's letter is that Krabappel told Moe..."
2506	"Geez, if everyone was like you, our morgues would be empty."
2507	This is so humiliating.
2508	"If I did it right, it's permanent."
2509	Duh. Trashin' the hotel room.
2510	"Lisa, if I ever stop loving violence, I want you to shoot me."
2511	Put it in! Put it in!
2512	"Dear Advertisers: I am disgusted with the way old people are depicted on television. We are not all vibrant, fun-loving sex maniacs. Many of us are bitter, resentful individuals who remember the good old days when entertainment was bland and inoffensive. The following is a list of words I never want to hear on television again. Number one: Bra. Number two: Horny. Number three: Family jewels."
2513	"Oh, Mom. I've seen what you do around the house, and I can handle it. Maybe I can even make things more efficient."
2514	"Yes, but doesn't the Bible also say, ""Thou shalt not take moochers into thy... hut""?"
2515	Hollywood-is-leading-our-kids-down-a-moral-sewer-Gotta-go!
2516	"Dad, do you remember why you entered me in that pageant?"
2517	"Do your worst, protesters you can't stop me from living my life!"
2518	"Aw, look how happy she is."
2519	"Man, I got a bad lawyer."
2520	"Hey Marge, watch me burn Flanders. Ned Flanders bids fifty dollars."
2521	"Yeah, well I won the belching contest at work."
2522	"What I want is a really good ""weeper."""
2523	For my first impression...
2524	"Oh, that's convenient."
2525	"You know Homer, I let a lot of things slide, but when you can't keep a roof over your family's head, you're just not much of a father."
2526	"So, is he alive or not?"
2527	We would if we had one.
2528	I'll pick you up at five tomorrow. And I'll pick you up right now.
2529	Are there any jive-talking robots in this play?
2530	"Thanks, honey. So you're not cool with any of the toys?"
2531	"Oh, so I've been replaced by a machine?"
2532	And he gambles like crazy.
2533	"You're right, I'm sorry. Tell you what: Saturday night we'll go out for steaks, just you and me."
2534	"I'm sure she's just running late. Or, she's not coming because she doesn't understand how special you are."
2535	"Aw, I can't stay mad at you when that pan smells like sausage and onions."
2536	"You know, some women find bald men quite virile."
2537	"Well, I'm not not licking toads... Well, it's time to get to work. Humanitarian Homer Simpson, over and out."
2538	"Forget about him, Dad. I'm proud of you."
2539	"Oh my God. She's gonna jump. Marge, don't do it! Give divorce a chance!"
2540	"Well, might be a few. But don't worry about it. If you leave them alone, they'll leave you alone."
2541	"Oh, you mind if I tag along? I'm kind of a crime buff."
2542	Stop that sniffing! It's not for you! They're making the house next door smell like cookies so people will subconsciously want to buy it.
2543	"Red. The trucker. Big fat guy, couldn't handle his steak?"
2544	We found you smoldering in the bushes.
2545	"Bart, your mother thinks there's something suspicious about all you boys having a meeting in this treehouse."
2546	I can't believe how many manatees we saved today.
2547	Willie?! You're on Skinner's side?
2548	This is the worst pain imaginable!
2549	You are not bringing that thing home.
2550	"Come 'n' get it. Woo! Heh, heh, heh. Come `n get it. Woo! Heh, heh, heh. Stupid dolphin."
2551	It's a lot of little stuff. God has to pay all the elves in his workshop... plus he's got all those planets to support -- you see that ring he gave Saturn?
2552	Rock and Roll! Woo hoo!
2553	... ha.mo.shel be.khol-a.sher-lo sim-na yad.kha ta.khat ...
2554	You sure none of you guys gave me this?
2555	"Yeah, I'm gonna scam this town out of so many presents. And what I don't use, I'm gonna return... for store credit!"
2556	I put my homemade football on hold and set to work making the world's greatest bat.
2557	Bart! You're just pretending to know what I'm talking about.
2558	"It's gonna be one wholesome evening. So, do you think Marge could take care of rowdy Roddy and Typhoon Todd?"
2559	"Need directions, or a bottle of water?"
2560	"Vroom vroom. Vroom vroom... Vroom, vroom."
2561	"Mom, I want to be a rock star."
2562	My Dad used to tie me up when the ice cream truck went by. And now there's no amount of ice cream that'll make me feel full. So this should work!
2563	"Well, need some help there? You know, maybe you folks should come over and hunker in our bunker."
2564	"That's exactly the poi-- Oh, Simpson, can't you go five seconds without humiliating yourself?"
2565	"Television, jumping box, pict-o-cube, just crank it up."
2566	"I think you've had enough, sister. C'mon, let's keep it moving."
2567	You call that a slap? Make me slap you.
2568	"Man, when you're not at work, you see so many beautiful things."
2569	I don't think Bob won that election legally. I can't believe a convicted felon would get so many votes and another convicted felon would get so few.
2570	...you're hosting my Preteen Braves meeting...
2571	"Look, this church is our only option. Don't you kids want to live here?"
2572	Sentence fragment is also a sentence fragment.
2573	"One of you ate tin cans, one of you ate health food. How you solved crimes I'll never know."
2574	That's the way we do it every year.
2575	"Look, I know that to you we Simpsons are a lower order of life. We face that prejudice every day of our lives, but we are happy on our little planet. We throw ourselves on your mercy. Please return us to..."
2576	"Mr. Scorpio says productivity is up 2%, and it's all because of my motivational techniques, like donuts and the possibility of more donuts to come."
2577	The home told us you were dead.
2578	American Applesauce Association?!
2579	"No, no, no -- the solution was ""Regally the rock gem is Lisa""."
2580	Bear Patrol Tax: $5?! What?! This is an outrage! It's the biggest tax increase in history!
2581	"Aren't we a little young for makeup and... What do you mean, five pounds?"
2582	Africa looks like a beautiful jewel.
2583	"Come on, Seymour! Mau! Didi mau!"
2584	"Aw, she's taking a nap."
2585	Bart! You can't weld with such a little flame. Stupid kid.
2586	"Ooo, a hundred and three! No school today."
2587	"Okay, before I show ya, who wants to guess how I got the money?"
2588	"See, even when you yell at me, I can see love in your eyes."
2589	Will I pass my English test?
2590	"Well, you can't possibly like Maggie best. What has she ever done? Nothin' for nobody!"
2591	"No, Bart. For all we know, hundreds of rescue workers are digging us out right now."
2592	"Uh, that's right. The U.N. doesn't look too kindly on..."
2593	"Not if those gutters aren't clean, you don't."
2594	"On the closing day!/ The escrow agents pay!/ Taxes, liens, and interest, too, thanks to Fannie Mae!"
2595	"I'll take him out, sir."
2596	Woo hoo! It's almost New Year's! Ten... nine... eight...
2597	Run for your life!... ... Boy!
2598	And then I turn into a snarling beast. Talk about flunking the old turn-the-other-cheek test!
2599	How did you get tickets?
2600	Quiet. God looks like he has something important to say.
2601	"All right, I'm gonna..."
2602	Your present is leaving.
2603	I've got an idea... but I'll need that broccoli.
2604	"YES, I STRUT DOWN THE BOULEVARD / BURNING OFF MY EXCESS LARD..."
2605	"Aw, they're not so tough."
2606	"Thanks, but I don't really like soup."
2607	No question about it.
2608	"She's a superfreak, superfreak, she's superfreaky, yow!"
2609	"What do you mean? It says right here: ""Free wig with every purchase of large wig. Downtown Wig Center."" Why you little... Hmmm... Free wig."
2610	"Aw, look at that -- my little guy's finally realizing how complicated grown-up feelings can be."
2611	Bart! Lisa! Stop that.
2612	"Say, how 'bout a little NyQuil?"
2613	"Lisa, your father and I are very concerned about this warning. I really hope you try harder."
2614	"Yeah, probably. Anyway, once upon a time there was a big mean lion who got a thorn in his paw. And all the village people tried to pull it out, but nobody was strong enough. So they got Hercules, and Hercules used his mighty strength, and bingo. Anyway, the moral is, the lion was so happy, he gave Hercules this big thing of riches."
2615	"I like beer, hot dogs, and long blackouts on the beach."
2616	So hungry... can't leave car... Huh...
2617	Everything's coming up Milhouse!
2618	"Reverend, I gave Ned Flanders some bad advice. Now he could be in real trouble."
2619	"Don't give me that kiss of death, you black widow!"
2620	"That video really opened my eyes. I can see that I'm just a passive-aggressive co-culprit. By nagging you when you do foolish things, I just enable your life-script."
2621	"Oh my, you're burning up. I'm going to tell the school you're staying home."
2622	And the winner is... Principal Skinner!
2623	What did I say about pointing out the meaninglessness of things?
2624	"Bart, we can't just let her get away with this."
2625	"Yes, I regained consciousness during my big dance number. Those strings pulling me every which way jostled my heart from its slumber."
2626	Then why are you running the obstacle course?
2627	"Hm, I'm not sure. Let me check."
2628	I'm listening. And it better be devastating.
2629	"Oh, hello friends. I'm Montgomery Burns, your next governor, and I'm here to talk to you about my little friend, here. Blinky."
2630	"Belt is by Twizzler, vest courtesy of Nelson, tights are by Hello Kitty..."
2631	"Hello, Reverend. We're glad we could come. Oh, hello Helen."
2632	"Well, I'm sure glad we didn't turn into mindless zombies."
2633	"Homer, can I get you a beer?"
2634	I'm going to Dizzyland!
2635	"Oh, get that away from me!"
2636	"We sold it, didn't we?"
2637	"Congratulations, Roz."
2638	"Okay, it's the standard Grampa drill. Everybody into the cellar!"
2639	Who am I kidding? I'm not enjoying this -- even the foam tastes like nothing. I'm calling Homer.
2640	"Excuse me, I just heard that before Spider-Man was a movie it was a comic book. Is that possible?"
2641	"Ah, the mirthless laugh of the damned. Hold your nose, Smithers, we're going in!"
2642	"Son, I'm doing something I should have done a long time ago... taking you to Vegas!"
2643	"You mean, I'm on my own? I've never been on my own. Oh no! On own! On own! I need help. Oh, God help me! Help me, God!"
2644	We'd better stop and get the car washed.
2645	"...but we aren't making a baby. I thought we should check, to make sure Homer has... you know, working stunt-men in his cannon."
2646	"Hey, no one with a choice should ever have to be a girl. I'll teach you how to be a boy."
2647	"Okay, Hibbert's in surgery, but they're having him paged."
2648	Where'd you learn that trick? In the Army?
2649	This place blows. I'm gonna go float a Baby Ruth down the mineral bath.
2650	And this is Lord Thistlewick Flanders...
2651	"Sure, they could be here. Who knows?"
2652	"Oh yeah? Who played your daughter in the short-lived sitcom, ""President Clown""?"
2653	"Pine needle... sorbet... Pine needle sorbet!! My kids do not eat sorbet, they eat sherbet, and they pronounce it ""sherbert"" and they wish it was ice cream!"
2654	Nothing like a tall glass of luke-warm water to Jekyll down this Hyde.
2655	Did you really have to handcuff the children?
2656	"...after we show you the wealth of jobs in the steno pool, a hearty luncheon of bison with lake beaver will be served..."
2657	And only one of you kids can go to college.
2658	"I'm fine! Fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine..."
2659	Beer? I thought you guys didn't drink on the Gayflower.
2660	"Safety? But, sir, if truth be known, I actually caused more accidents around here than any other employee. There were even a few doozies no one ever found out about."
2661	Yeah! What about zero?
2662	"If I get up, somebody'll take my chair."
2663	"This is pretty tense, isn't it, Todd?"
2664	They were only on for twenty minutes!
2665	I wish I had a cell phone.
2666	Keep your greasy mitts outta there.
2667	And why is Krusty on the couch?
2668	"Homie, I'd like you to do something for me."
2669	"Hey, it was all a coincidence!"
2670	Who's the greatest billionaire in the world?!
2671	"Don't worry, honey, I'm sure your father is..."
2672	I could take up smoking.
2673	Ow! You are such an immature-- punch buggy white!
2674	"Sure thing, Mr. Burns."
2675	I can't believe the man who agreed to follow my daughter around -- for money -- would turn out to be a dirt bag.
2676	I did not! I promised I would get mad! She's an eight-year-old girl.
2677	He's causing us all to yell!
2678	Me! Me! Me! Me! Me! I said it first!
2679	"No, I got hit by a couple of cars. I won't be able to play today."
2680	She says you're a bad influence.
2681	There's so much evil in the world.
2682	time I wreck your life?
2683	"Let's see, I could help someone in any impoverished area on earth. Bangladesh... Bolivia... East Springfield?!"
2684	"So, kids, what do you want to play?"
2685	"I'm looking forward to visiting the arctic circle, or as I call it, my wife's side of the bed. For the purposes of that joke, I'm married."
2686	You disobeyed your manager!
2687	There was barbecue sauce on it.
2688	You told him our secret?!
2689	"Yeah, I bet the old people will be acting like young people, like in those cell phone ads everyone hates."
2690	"All right, folks show's over. No more to see, folks. Only sick people want to see my folks kiss."
2691	Hmm. Probably a reminder to relax more.
2692	Teenage vandals smashing the bar! Moe's gonna kill me.
2693	"Oh. Okay, that's quite enough, it's not funny anymore."
2694	"Fine. Should we take one car, or should I follow you?"
2695	"Aw, shoot. All right, all right. Give me one bowl."
2696	But that's not what P.E.T.A. stands--
2697	"No, away from the skid!"
2698	Now's our chance. Let's go!
2699	"Here we are at school, kids."
2700	"The elderly aren't like you or me, Bart. They thrive on consistency, predictability, and a life with no surprises."
2701	"First you have the skin, then the sweet, sweet innards."
2702	"It was an accident, I swear!"
2703	What are all our friends names again?
2704	Fathers have to say that stuff.
2705	"Thanks a lot, Bart. All right, how can we pay off our foreign debt?"
2706	"Sweetie, you don't understand. If I can do this myself, then all those lies I told will be true. Don't you want Daddy's lies to be true?"
2707	"Hey, Dad. Can you move your head?"
2708	"No, the science fair's not till next week!"
2709	"Goodbye, Adil. I'll send you those civil defense plans you wanted."
2710	Not if we want that vacation.
2711	That's a DVD of a Fellini movie!
2712	"Do you think it's fair that you're always getting into trouble, yet Mom and Dad are being punished?"
2713	"Well, I'd like to thank you both for cooperating with our DID YOU DO IT?!"
2714	"Moe, get the darts. I want to play."
2715	"I was always cheering for you, Grampa. Till now."
2716	But I guess I should find out a little bit about you.
2717	Are you sure you're here voluntarily?
2718	"Oh man, now they won't let Krusty do anything fun."
2719	I'm fighting the robber -- you go get ice cream!
2720	"Lisa Simpson, master of the double life."
2721	Thank God I landed in a bunch of fruity birds.
2722	"Ah, we're so lucky to have this untouched piece of paradise so close to Springfield."
2723	Right. How much longer is she gonna be here? Homer was a little sketchy on the details.
2724	Sheesh! You're the most paranoid family I've ever been affiliated with.
2725	You don't have TV? But what will I watch while I'm sitting on the couch?
2726	"Eh, nothing we can do."
2727	Oooh -- Oh -- so close!
2728	"I knew you'd need some help keepin' it real, so I figured I could be, like, your co-President."
2729	"And Lord, if you think I'm making lemon bars for your bake sale Sunday, you'd better stop killing our cats."
2730	"Aww... thanks, Flanders. Gotta warn ya, he doesn't talk much."
2731	Go on! Swim to freedom! Go!
2732	"Relax, boy, we're not gonna cook you. Enjoy your day at the beach! Ooh, look."
2733	"Sadly, no. I'm disappointed with the way you acted today... but I'm not surprised."
2734	I don't know! I invited everyone that Lisa's ever met.
2735	You know that new baby brother Ralph's been bragging about? It's just a pinecone.
2736	"Goodbye, Lisa -- I know you'll make me proud."
2737	"Um... you're in the wrong house, lady."
2738	Wow! / Air show! / Cool! /
2739	"And now, let's have even more fun."
2740	"Ma'am, whatever you do, do not marry that ape."
2741	"What is this, tough love?"
2742	"No kiddin'. What do you think of my page, Lisa? Be honest. It's great, isn't it? Go ahead and say it's great if you want to."
2743	"Are you comfortable in there, Luke Perry?"
2744	"I don't have time to read. Just give me the gist of it, son."
2745	I learned from the master.
2746	That's the kind of faucet I want for your bathroom.
2747	Do you have a disrespectful son who calls you by your first name?
2748	"Nothing! Nothing! Can't feel my fingers! Feel them too much. Erection! Derection! I smell music! Oh, this'll never work... but when you're doin' it with people you love, you just can't help smilin'."
2749	"Hey, the pocket wants what it wants."
2750	I just need to get to sixty percent.
2751	"I believe they prefer to be called ""conjoined twins."""
2752	"What! You did! Well, that's just... oh, what a glorious day! Lisa, hand me your paper."
2753	This trapdoor app works like a charm! Excellent.
2754	"Lisa's gone berserk! Do something, Homer! Do something!"
2755	But I siphoned that gas from Flanders! Flanders...
2756	"I'm so sorry for all your horrible problems, but this is our dog's room now."
2757	I'll never last here.
2758	Isn't mid-season just a dumping ground for second-rate shows that weren't good enough for the fall schedule?
2759	"Three it is! You're the teacher, and I accept your decision."
2760	"I just want you to know that I love you, Dad."
2761	"Now, in case all that smilin' didn't cheer ya up, there's one thing that never fails. A nice glass of warm milk, a little nap, and a total frontal lobotomy."
2762	"Homer, you promised to be nice to my sisters."
2763	"You know, I rented another tape... in case you felt better."
2764	Accursed tide! Flee from my wrath!
2765	Well... someday I'd like to go on a nice vacation.
2766	"Oh, great. The painting is worthless...this was all for nothing. And when Marge finds out she's gonna kill me."
2767	My homework is in your park.
2768	"Why, why does this have to be so hard?"
2769	My mother... my bully... my God!
2770	"What, what, what, what, what, what, what? This better be about pizza."
2771	"Now see here, Little Miss Scene Stealer, I'm the star of the show. You're just the reason people tune in."
2772	"Don't mind me boys, just scrubbing my undies."
2773	"Sure, Smithers! / He's a good suspect! / Oh, I bet he's the one! / Definitely Smithers!"
2774	Oh brother. Let's dance.
2775	"Don't tell me what to do, Sonny. I've been gambling since I was eight. And I've been hockin' jewelry since I was twelve. Now give me some chips!"
2776	"You invented Itchy? The ""Itchy and Scratchy"" Itchy?"
2777	What can you do? Sex sells.
2778	"Homer, the reason I hate this car is... I think I want another baby!"
2779	"I love you too, Jerry."
2780	Do you even know what a loft is?
2781	You would've guessed wrong.
2782	"Don't give up hope, Johnny!"
2783	Then I'll have been on every continent.
2784	"Hey, Homer! Your butt still looks big from down here!"
2785	"Oh, why do all my trips end like this?"
2786	So we have an agreement?
2787	"Did you hear that, Marge? My boy speaks French."
2788	No doubt! Can't a girl fabulize herself before the big dance?
2789	"Well, you're still my hero."
2790	Grampa! You have a job?
2791	"Please, please, please!"
2792	"Great, Martin. Now, the big test is tomorrow and I haven't even started to study..."
2793	"Well, I've only read it in books."
2794	Dealing drugs? That's impossible. He... he doesn't have the math skills!
2795	"Eh, it's my metabmobolism. I guess I'm just one of the lucky ones."
2796	"Mm, I think I've found my mentor."
2797	We've got to get you to a doctor right away.
2798	Mr. Flanders? This new reverend has thrown tar in your half-pipe too?
2799	Professional athletes. Always wantin' more.
2800	But I played baseball this morning!
2801	"That's it, Bart. You're taking this man-of-the-house thing too far."
2802	"Hey Krusty, you're making a huge mistake not hiring my brother. Why don't you hire them both? It won't cost you anything -- you could call Bart an intern."
2803	"Anytime, honey. Just remember, never be afraid to live life on the edge. Now let's get home before your mother kills us."
2804	"Yeah, you should go to bed, Grampa. We've had a big day."
2805	Yes! She loves me! She loves me!
2806	"Yeah, well Lenny said it."
2807	"Because I was thinking about the American family! One family in particular, who was stepped on by the government and had nowhere else to turn."
2808	Why Bart is right here.
2809	You want fries with that?
2810	"Geez, so many dolphins..."
2811	"See, Bart? There's another boy who played with glue."
2812	You have a drinking problem?
2813	Your toy company is evil.
2814	It's gonna be awesome!
2815	But what if someone bad tells me to...
2816	"Well, it's worth a try don't you--"
2817	"C'mon guys, look at yourselves. All you do is study. I'm gonna show you the true meaning of college!"
2818	"Oh doctor, I was in a wonderful place filled with fire and brimstone. And there were all these guys in red pajamas sticking pitchforks in my butt."
2819	"Don't worry, kids. These wool socks and down parkas will keep you warm."
2820	Really? But nerds are my mortal enemy.
2821	"Well Homer, too. They're so much alike."
2822	"Well, um, thanks, but I've been wondering... why do you only have me make spheres, rods, and half-moon shapes?"
2823	Ooh! Ahh! Ooh! Ahh! Ahh! Ahh! Ohh!
2824	We'll give you a ride.
2825	"Oh, he'll agitate ya. Ho, ho. He sure will. What can we do for you?"
2826	"I got a head injury at work, and they gave me eight weeks paid vacation."
2827	I can't believe you did that to me.
2828	There goes the clothesline.
2829	"Also, I can't sleep at night 'cause there's this new bully who follows me home and..."
2830	The funeral's in Little Neck Falls. Looks like we'll have to go to Duff Gardens another time.
2831	Not if I can help it. And help it I might.
2832	But we don't have that kind of money.
2833	"No can do, Marge. My first duty is to the season-ticket holders. But don't worry, I've got the entire opera house on a complete lockdown."
2834	"Oh my sweet, undigested baby!"
2835	I got the idea from a now-discredited book on raising children.
2836	"Moe, my family's gone, my dog hates me, and I can't remember what happened last night. Was I here?"
2837	"Mount Springfield, eh? Strap on your crampons, boys!"
2838	Just an innocuous little symbol like a smiley face or a like an I.O.U.
2839	"What's the matter, don't you people read the papers? Ahh, let's look at some clips."
2840	"Let's have a warm Krusty welcome for my estranged father, Rabbi Hyman Krustofsky."
2841	Here's your breakfast.
2842	I thought this would happen. I just hope you replace me with something as educational and uplifting as I've tried to be.
2843	"Homer, this says I've won Homemaker magazine's ""Clean for a Day"" contest!"
2844	What's going on up there?
2845	But I guess I was wrong. You are a bad father.
2846	"Hey, you know. I'm a lot like that guy."
2847	Just like me on Twitter!
2848	But I need that beer now.
2849	"Yeah, right, I'll just type it up on my invisible typewriter. Fruitcake."
2850	"Don't you see, Milhouse? We've gone too far. We need Skinner back."
2851	"One more crack out of you, young man, and I'm showing everyone your baby pictures."
2852	What?! You cry all the time! You cried when they canceled that show you hated.
2853	"Oh, Mister Price, I loved you in The Abominable Doct..."
2854	"Although I must admit, they know where to stop."
2855	You know it. Plus he gave me this appointment dealy.
2856	"Barney, how'd you like to sing for our group?"
2857	"All right, all right. Keep your top on."
2858	"After we got Maggie to a safe house, of course."
2859	"Stonecutters, eh? How do I join?"
2860	"Okay Marge, you test drove a convertible once, you can do this."
2861	"Step on it, Mom. Dad's signaling that he wants to go higher."
2862	"Hi, everyone. I'm Bart Simpson, the creator of ""Angry Dad."" To make this film, I had to miss countless hours of school, and there was also some hardship. I hope you like it as much as I do."
2863	"Thanks for the food, Mister..."
2864	"Listen, you're a persistent fellow, but I--"
2865	"Face it, Lis -- men are dogs. The worse we treat you, the more you want us."
2866	Oh my God! I've got to do something.
2867	My own art show?! I'm so happy... do you mind?
2868	I don't see any cameras.
2869	"...our radio-man, Sheldon Skinner..."
2870	Could this be the best day of my life?
2871	One day you'll be more haunted by those words than I am.
2872	I'd rather not go than lie.
2873	"Okay. Your wish is my command, my little..."
2874	Has anyone mentioned that Homer doesn't know anything about mountain climbing and that this is all crazy?
2875	Let's get that! The suffocation thing!
2876	"Nooo, I just want to have a heart-to-heart talk."
2877	"Now, for the record, I hated the building, the people in it and the spirit it represented. I never hated the church itself. And now, finally, I believe in something bigger than myself."
2878	Come on. We're going to be late.
2879	Boys! Stop! You can both marry me.
2880	But I'm on a hot streak.
2881	"Well, good work, Blue-hair 'n' Brocko-witch. Okay, that was mine."
2882	I want you to hear what Malibu Stacy is telling a generation of little girls.
2883	"Well if you keep throwing the word around, it means nothing."
2884	"Oh, so extortion is the name of your little game, is it Simpson? Very well. Then you get nothing. I have the finest lawyers in Springfield, Simpson. Tangle with me and I'll crush you like a paper cup."
2885	"Well, thanks for the chicken dinner. How did you know I wanted one?"
2886	"Just so I don't wonder... You would've gone all the way with me, wouldn't you?"
2887	Now you know how I'll feel when you go to college.
2888	"But, there is one condition..."
2889	"Oh, this thing'll do anything. Watch, I'll ask it how many leagues in a furlong. No, wait... I'll make it say ""Whatsa matta you?"" in Turkish."
2890	Stupid Catholic school. Suffering for my hip attitude... I'm the real Jesus here!
2891	Where's all the money?
2892	"What would Ben Franklin say if he were alive today? He'd say... oh, think of a better opening."
2893	I guess we're down to just me.
2894	And what about my new job as a Mexican wrestler?
2895	"Homie, what's going on?"
2896	"Uh-huh... Uh-huh... Oh, I thought Muddy Waters wrote that song."
2897	"Look... uh... how 'bout we go to the pound, and get a puppy just for you?"
2898	You're selling what now?
2899	Oh lord! Now what are we going to do? Just let the trash pile up?
2900	"Dad, here's a thought: if you just gave Mom credit, maybe she could help you."
2901	Maybe Mom just doesn't realize we miss her. We could go down to the casino and let her know.
2902	Enough with the tricks!
2903	"Yeah, this is Milhouse. He's my best friend, because ... well, geographical convenience really."
2904	The vintage record store?
2905	I don't know. I feel naked without it.
2906	"C'mon, say something conclusive."
2907	It's impossible. I killed you.
2908	"What are you, simple? That's my old mine detector from the war."
2909	"Oh, tomorrow's the day the judge said we can visit Bart."
2910	Wanna make out over the foul line?
2911	"Funny story, Kent. It's the end of the world! God loves you! He's gonna kill you!"
2912	"Friends and well-wishers, yes."
2913	Serves her right fer bein' a sixties radical. Though she was a demon in the sack.
2914	"Grocery store, please!"
2915	"You're welcome. And if you really want to get your belly button pierced, go see a professional."
2916	"Bart, you're not laughing. Too subtle?"
2917	Now that's a fight I wanna be a part of.
2918	Get a load of those freaks.
2919	Rock 'n' Roll Fantasy Camp!
2920	"Bart, look! It's Santa Claus!"
2921	I already work for you.
2922	"Hey, Homer! Check it out!"
2923	"Ahh, the ole fishin' hole. So peaceful and relaxing, it doesn't even matter if I catch a single fish."
2924	"He's doing ""Dreamcoat"" at the dinner theater."
2925	"Come on, Dad, pick up the pace. Chew and swallow, no savoring."
2926	"Mom and Dad, Bart is going to use the old subway to destroy Springfield Elementary!"
2927	"Yeah, it's time for an old-fashioned hippie ass-whomping."
2928	I need you to help me get a passing grade.
2929	"Oh, no! It's eating us!"
2930	The kids are a mess! You brought them home exhausted and pretentious!
2931	"Instead of a carnival ride, what if he was run over by a Zamboni with a moustache?"
2932	"Let's see, Powell, Powell... Powell... Pomerant, Poole, Popkin, Potter, Quigley, Quimby, Randolph... whoops, too far. Here it is, Powell."
2933	"Mm-hmm. I'm happy about that. But, I think you can be a good teacher and still respect our privacy."
2934	"Mrs. Krabappel, in figuring out my final grades, I hope you'll note that all of my textbooks are being returned in excellent condition. In some cases, still in their original wrappings."
2935	"And if you don't, at least you'll be bigger than the other kids."
2936	...so they need a place to stay. Here.
2937	Wipe that smile off your face.
2938	"You expect me to believe all this? If any of it was true, wouldn't I have a big, hideous scar..."
2939	Bart! I cracked the code of the pictograph. It says there's a curse on the mound. Of course I don't believe in...
2940	"I finally feel like me again. You're not disappointed, are you?"
2941	Oh of course I do! That's why we're such a great team!
2942	But Santa can't be evil...
2943	Woo hoo! Flanders isn't perfect!
2944	"Smithers, I'm a proud fellow, and it's not easy for me to admit defeat. But I know just the thing to make me feel better -- shopping!"
2945	Fine. Just stay here and hold down the fort.
2946	What's wrong with stinky?
2947	I made everyone happy but me. Some Christmas. Feliz Navidad.
2948	"No, sir. I'm really sorry sir. An older boy told me to do it."
2949	"So, what are we going to see?"
2950	That doesn't sound like your kind of movie.
2951	"Right, right. Blocko shirt."
2952	"He'd say ""I'm a grown man who's scared of my own son."""
2953	I know that. How much to fix it?
2954	"Aw, he's trying to eat ewectwicity."
2955	Saved by the bell from eternity in Hell!
2956	Behold the real egg-flinging fiend!
2957	"Kids, your mother's under a lot of pressure. Why don't we let her clear the table in peace?"
2958	"So that ""natural selection"" was the origin of this species?"
2959	Aww... maybe a hug will cork her cry-hole.
2960	"I'll tell you what I want, Marge. I want to make another Simpson. The table with four legs is sturdier than the table with three. Cubes are made of cheese, but pyramids are schemes. And anything that's half you is guaranteed fifty percent perfect."
2961	"Come on, Lisa! Hurry!"
2962	"I owe it all to my rewarding work with children, and not picking at it."
2963	"Smithers, what's going on? How dare you interrupt my lime rickey? State your business."
2964	"I want to help you, George Washington? Even your dreams are square."
2965	Makes me laugh. Let's go.
2966	"C'mon, I'd be an awesome big brother! I've got videogames! A treehouse! A garage stuffed to the rafters with illegal fireworks!"
2967	"I'm not horny, I'm mad."
2968	On a Friday afternoon?! I bet he's playing poker again!
2969	"Oh, uh... you know what they say, ""hammer with the wood and it's all good."""
2970	"With our superior intellects, we could rebuild this city on a foundation of reason and enlightenment. We could turn Springfield into a utopia!"
2971	"Does too. I mean without the head, of course."
2972	Or that lady who wheels Larry Flynt around!
2973	"Far too much dancing, not nearly enough prancing."
2974	Just tell them about yourself.
2975	It's like a Thomas The Tank Engine we can go inside!
2976	"Hold it right there, Bub. What kind of civilized people eat the body and blood of their savior?"
2977	I have many people to thank...
2978	"Yeah, they beat me up at work. Look at the word they wrote on my skull."
2979	"I'm gonna miss you, spit brother."
2980	I appreciate you trying to become more attractive for me. But the truth is... I'm way too successful for you now. I'm gettin' me a trophy husband!
2981	"Oh Bart, my troubled little lamb. You'll be in jail for so long. But I'll keep your room just the way it was: a pigsty."
2982	How are we gonna get him out of here?
2983	"Why is it always me? I work twelve hours a week, you know!"
2984	We're rehearsing a play.
2985	"Listen, I gotta tell ya, I chew in my sleep."
2986	"We'd like to dedicate this next number to a very special woman. She's 100 years old, and she weighs over 200... ... tons."
2987	No. It couldn't be...
2988	"I guess I'll have to. Then I'll be queen of the world! Of spelling. That's right, queen of the world! Of spelling."
2989	"Here, Marge, let me. Hate to be an armchair Blanche, but I always gave it one of these..."
2990	"I expect insolence, but rank insolence? Off with his job!"
2991	I'm not really about gum. But I like the whole chewing thing...
2992	Have you ever walked on stilts? It's not that great.
2993	"Oh well, Thank you, Doctor, you've changed my life!"
2994	We better call Ned. He has a ladder.
2995	"Okay, what if I pay for it myself?"
2996	"Everything's covered in foam. And it's owned by a corporation, so you know it's safe."
2997	Your hair is growing back! Tell me your secret!
2998	"Moe, I think we'd both be a lot happier if we quit our new jobs."
2999	But I am far more pessimistic.
3000	"Out, damn'd spot! Out, I say!"
3001	"Look, Dad! ""Players and Coaches' Entrance!"""
3002	There's something you should know about me.
3003	No! I'm leaving this church forever!
3004	"What say you now, Goliath? Without your precious hair, you no longer possess your fantastic strength!"
3005	I punched Mr. Burns right in his 104 year-old face.
3006	Open this door right now!
3007	"If you're my wife's secret lover, come in. There's nothing I can do for her anymore."
3008	"Heh, heh, heh. Yeah they swore they'd get us back by spiking our water supply. But they didn't have the guts."
3009	Calendar! Oh my God! I forgot to move Carl's twelve-thirty to two-thirty.
3010	"Well, no... just Ringo Starr."
3011	Those are girl overalls.
3012	"Could you explain your model, young man?"
3013	"Lisa, that was very selfish of you."
3014	"Oh, I don't want to be a bother."
3015	I agree. Hey! Aren't you that crazy Cat Lady?
3016	I give up. I don't deserve to live with you.
3017	"Lame, lame, lame, lame, have it, lame, Superman Dies, Aquaman Dies, Casper Dies, Caveman Robin, Black Robin, Born-Again Robin..."
3018	"What's this thing? ""Miranda Rights Teleprompter?"""
3019	Homer... you're not going to school.
3020	Gimme some quarters. I'm doing my laundry.
3021	What is it this time?
3022	"I reluctantly accept this highly-paid, glamorous job."
3023	Krusty! This once-vibrant young bully won't even live to pick on kids in junior high! Because he's been eating nothing but your food!
3024	"Hey, now let's not do anything rash... God is love, right?"
3025	"So, this is your mysterious new job for Mr. Burns?"
3026	Good. Commence shovelling.
3027	Could you at least tell me what you're planning to do with me?
3028	Oh no we don't! Judge Snyder?
3029	Wh... what's going on? Wh... wha... why am I on a Japanese box?
3030	"No you didn't. You only passed your course by cheating, which you always taught us was wrong."
3031	"Well, we can't just stand here staring at our hands."
3032	"Maybe I do, Chief. Maybe I do..."
3033	"Well, if it'll seal the deal, I'll take a look at your septic tank. See if I can get her hummin' again."
3034	www.nuclear-secrets.com.
3035	"I've never gone behind Mr. Burns' back before, but Sideshow Bob's ultra-conservative views conflict with my, choice of lifestyle."
3036	"Okay, I assume you all know why you're here."
3037	My wife thinks you want me to pay for it.
3038	It's hard to believe we're never going to see Maude again.
3039	"Oh Mom, that felt awful."
3040	"Well, that's the craziest thing I'll ever see."
3041	Would you like some fruit juice?
3042	"Not so fast, Pig! We're making a stand. A freaky stand! You can smash this drug barn all you want, but first you'll have to smash our heads open like ripe melons!"
3043	Nemo doesn't have a mother.
3044	I have listening skills!
3045	"You're so busy thinking up crazy ways to punish people, you can't see how much I love my kids."
3046	I was hanging onto these gift cards as investments... but then half the companies went out of business. Better sort those out.
3047	"So, uh, you guys are my new coworkers."
3048	No problem. Hey Drederick!
3049	"Homer, can you breathe?!"
3050	"Uh, you missed the turn-off, Mr. Warren."
3051	"Look at all those beautiful shoes! I know they're made from animals, but wow!"
3052	"Hello, Phillip! What are you doing here?"
3053	"Ow! Oh no, I'm being erased!"
3054	"Aw, I'd hug ya, but I know you'd just get embarrassed."
3055	Objection! Unhealthy!
3056	"Talk louder? You bet. Naturally, I threw my old chair in the dumpster right away. But then Lenny said ""No, that was the new chair. That memo was two months old!"" So now I'm sitting on an orange crate. I never felt so--"
3057	"This town can't teach its kids or collect its garbage, but we lead the nation in pointless revenge."
3058	"Oh, won't anyone pretend to believe me?"
3059	I just wanted to see if there was a better life. Even for a little bit.
3060	SURE YOUR DAD'S SINGING / COULD MAKE YOUR HAIR CURL / BUT YOU TOO BART / HAVE SUNG AND DANCED LIKE A GIRL.
3061	This stupid thing never works.
3062	"Ooh, that'll save some time."
3063	I can't shoot a little girl...
3064	"This year give her English Muffins. Whatever you say, Mr. Billboard."
3065	Nothing. I give up. No more dinner parties. Our whole social life will be us watching TV and you going to Moe's.
3066	"You idiot! How am I ever going to find the key to the... ooh, here it is!"
3067	Don't worry. I am very good at keeping secrets.
3068	Yup. Right down to the scarf.
3069	"Hey, I'm just trying to make it easier on 'em."
3070	What a crazy room. There's no Albuquerque Isotopes. It's the Springfield... Ohhhh.
3071	"FIRST BASE, YO! / I LIKE CHRISTIAN RAP / A BIBLE ON MY LAP..."
3072	"Whoa, whoa. I didn't ask for your life story."
3073	"All right, screw it. Let's roll."
3074	"You don't have to call me ""Officer."" I'm not on duty here."
3075	"Lisa, I'm so impressed you're state champ."
3076	"Homer, your daughter doesn't want to get married."
3077	"Okay, swing. Run. Hit the thing. Now run across the..."
3078	"That's right, Ned. Those floozies we married in Vegas were crazy about you."
3079	"Yeah, this tether has some pluses."
3080	My name's Homer Simpson. I'd like to sign up for something.
3081	I just don't think you should get too excited about the woman who abandoned you for twenty-five years. You could get hurt again.
3082	"Hm, fascinating. Say doctor, can you do something about my searing pain?"
3083	"What's the matter, can't you find a hair style you like?"
3084	"KER-SHAW, KER-SHEW / I'M AFTER YOU / WITH MY BLOODY NOOSE / STRONG ENOUGH TO HANG TEN MOOSE / KER-SHAW, KER-SHEW / IT'S JUST A STORY, BUT IT'S REALLY TRUE!"
3085	"That's okay, happens all the time. Are you Mike Scioscia?"
3086	You promised you wouldn't drink!
3087	There is no virus! Bart faked the whole thing with a DVD! A direct-to-video DVD!
3088	"Uh, be careful there, Homer. That is sort of a new table."
3089	"They will be, Seymour. They will be."
3090	"That's Cameron. Girls go crazy over him. He's cute, unthreatening, and his smile brought a puppy back to life."
3091	That is one vicious baby bird.
3092	This is where the kids were last seen.
3093	Look at those eyes! There's an employee with a healthy case of the go-get-'ems!
3094	"Homer, don't you see? Our differences are only skin-deep..."
3095	What the hell's menopause?
3096	"Oh, my father gave me beer as a child. Till I wrapped my little red wagon around a tree."
3097	You see that stone angel up there? That's my mother's grave. My Dad points it out every time we drive by.
3098	Woo hoo! An unattended tap! Like takin' beer from a baby!
3099	Obesity is really unhealthy. Any doctor will tell you that.
3100	"One family, against all odds, took on the system... and lost."
3101	Dammit! Will you take a check?
3102	So you'd better catch the fever. Catch it...
3103	Fine. How's it goin'?
3104	"Hey, Mom! There's something in here!"
3105	"No, that's okay, Dad. I'll just work on my fingering. Unless my fingers clacking on the keys is too loud for you."
3106	"Well, Marge, what do you think?"
3107	"Well, I think I can make it out. ""Are you a homosex..."""
3108	"Ralph, I'm sorry I..."
3109	"All right, all right, who took the funny pages?"
3110	"Sir, is that your will?"
3111	No talking in the cage. Court is now in session. All rise.
3112	"Gee, I did the best I could..."
3113	"Excuse me, is this an orphanage?"
3114	Oh my God! What have I done?!
3115	Ow! My Flander-doodles!
3116	I'm finally riding the Tinseltown Starliner! I could die a happy man.
3117	"Oh Bart, I'm sure it's hard to lose your best friend."
3118	Yes they were! But now they won't be! Because I don't have a mini-bike!
3119	"Okay, that shows you what could potentially happen."
3120	I'm not supposed to look out the window when I'm alone.
3121	"Bart, please. Five bucks for a kiss."
3122	We'll see who's laughing when your house is smeared with ostrich albumen.
3123	"Homer, I hope you get this. I'm in jail and I need ten thousand dollars bail. Hurry!"
3124	And we don't even know whose gun that was. Maybe somebody planted it there to frame Dad.
3125	"Okay, okay, don't go Mary Todd on us."
3126	I know when the freakin' Fiesta Bowl is!
3127	"Okay, Bart. Back up the truck."
3128	"Mr. Mayor, I hate to break it to you, but your city is infested with bears."
3129	... And I contend that those tourists were decapitated before they entered the Krustyland House of Knives. Next question.
3130	I'll put a stop to this nonsense!
3131	"Mr. Brockman, you're a huge hit!"
3132	"Listen here. My name is Homer J. Simpson. You guys think I'm dead, but I'm not. Now I want you to straighten this out without a lot of your bureaucratic red tape and mumbo-jumbo."
3133	Big deal! I could juggle five pins if they let me use a unicycle.
3134	"Praise the Lord, I can walk again! What, my foot fell asleep."
3135	"Don't be afraid, little friend. You'll be the most popular crab on the beach."
3136	Is there any other kind?
3137	The father of the boy who doesn't win has to mow the lawn in his wife's Sunday dress.
3138	I have to take Maggie for her checkup. And a guy's coming to see what the smell is under the house.
3139	"So anyway, uh, your movie's wrapping up soon. I guess you'll be headin' out on the first bus to the airport. If you ride with a friend, you can save twenty bucks!"
3140	"Please, Mother. It's purely in the interest of science."
3141	"Listen, buster. I had to buy a club soda I didn't want to get change for this phone!"
3142	"Hey, since you were a no-show at all the big moments of my life, you owe me years of back presents: Christmases, birthdays, Easters, Kwaanzas, good report cards...at seventy-five bucks a pop, plus interest and penalties... You owe me twenty-two thousand dollars."
3143	"No, wait! Uh, uh, wait!... I, yes! I do have a story about two other young marrieds."
3144	We all went our separate ways.
3145	"Milhouse, if people believe you're a grownup, we could do anything."
3146	"Wait a minute, Doc! Your TV commercial said family bliss, or double our money back!"
3147	"You said you'd do something, and you followed through on it."
3148	"No, I mean they're mannequins!"
3149	"Marge, no one gains thirty pounds of bone."
3150	And the next contestant to be eliminated is... Clarissa!
3151	"Homer, would you at least let me take you out on a date?"
3152	You have a story with an ending?!
3153	"I know, but after it's evidence, it's a shirt again. Isn't it?"
3154	"Here's to a happy, well-rested Marge!"
3155	"I love you too, Homer."
3156	"My great-great, great-great great grandmother was a Native American. She was a member of the..."
3157	"Oh, I got it! Oh, it's just a thread! It was... She's got... she's got the washcloth!"
3158	Arctic Circle! I just got that!
3159	Dinner's ready! Dinner's ready!
3160	LISA IT'S YOUR BIRTHDAY / HAPPY BIRTHDAY LISA /
3161	And what's our time so far?
3162	This isn't normal TV. It's a videogame that encourages activity and exercise!
3163	Woo hoo! We won! We won!
3164	I think she needs a diaper change.
3165	Guess I chose the wrong day to wear culottes.
3166	The man who framed you is a crooked detective. Who I hired!
3167	Isn't all great art kind of a mirror?
3168	Wanna split it while we snuggle?
3169	"You know, Dad, it doesn't matter that we didn't see the alien. I've really had a great time out here."
3170	How are you a winner? You're cheating in a fake sport!
3171	"And ask yourselves, people, who's to blame for all this?"
3172	"I'm telling you, I saw a creature from another planet."
3173	"Why, here's Allison's real diorama. It got misplaced, ...or so it would seem."
3174	"There's something I think you should know. Homer, you have a half-brother."
3175	"Nice to meet you too, sir."
3176	"But you do get to express yourself. In the lovely home you keep, and the food you serve."
3177	"Aww, you guys are the meanest parents ever. Thank you."
3178	"Well, I would like to survive long enough to see the effects of global warming. I've got an inside tip that it's all a bunch of crap. Okay, you've found your snitch."
3179	They sound great... I'd love to read them sometime.
3180	"No need, Smithers. As usual, you've been the sober ""ying"" to my raging ""yang."" Put 'er there, old pal."
3181	Oh God oh God oh God!
3182	"What's your name, son?"
3183	"No, Maggie, don't go for the glitter. Look for substance."
3184	"Padre, can I be honest with you? I've sucked every church book ribbon there is hoping to find one made of cherry. But there isn't."
3185	"So you had a little scuffle, eh? Hope you won."
3186	"Dad, don't you want to know where we're going?"
3187	Lisa! Enough saxomophone already!
3188	"Smithers, there's no way I can lose this bet. Unless, of course, my nine all-stars fall victim to nine separate misfortunes and are unable to play tomorrow. But that will never happen. Three misfortunes, that's possible. Seven misfortunes, there's an outside chance. But nine misfortunes... I'd like to see that."
3189	"And some reporters and camera crews, but you don't need to feed them."
3190	He was one of the evillest men of the 1780's. He even tried to kill George Washington!
3191	A bunny! Just like the one I had when I was a girl! How did you know?
3192	My movie got in! I'm going to the Sundance Film Festival!
3193	Did you guys get home at two last night?
3194	"Flanders? I don't know... I mean, you haven't done anything for me since you lent me that five thousand bucks yesterday."
3195	He's a pig who can predict football winners... in advance!
3196	"With that little outfit on, everyone's gonna think you're playing in the tournament."
3197	Give my Dad another heart attack?!
3198	"And now, Marge's secret benefactor is going to get her the luxury she's always dreamed of: a toaster wide enough for bagels. I'll just take out a little money from my ""local branch."""
3199	The cops can't just slap a curfew on us. We have rights.
3200	"Bart, I'm having palpitations."
3201	"Oh, Maude, I turned your dream of a Christian amusement park into a bemusement park."
3202	I was a little girl...
3203	"Lisa, you like homework. Could you fill out this form for me?"
3204	"Homie, I'd like to know what you've been doing after work."
3205	I came up with the idea.
3206	"You and I are a dying breed, Simpson. I'm going to share something with you. Hop in."
3207	"Oh, it was so great. I didn't have to fake it with them. I was actually excited to hear about their day."
3208	"Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Let him out, Lou. Let him out!"
3209	"Well, frankly, I don't see how one of the most despicable men who ever lived has a chance against Mary Bailey, the most beloved governor our great state has ever known."
3210	Whew. I'm glad that wasn't us.
3211	"Dad, what's that on your lap?!"
3212	What do we need a psychiatrist for? We know our kid is nuts.
3213	"Masseuses: the half-doctors, half-hookers who solve everything."
3214	"Dad, I'm not gonna fall for that."
3215	"Oh, my little sugar-bug... I'm so glad you're safe..."
3216	"Uh, this is my brother Bart, who doesn't seem to realize this isn't the best time for his music. He's one of the people I want to help with my programs."
3217	You know those feet stickin' out from under the house in The Wizard of Oz? You're lookin' at 'em.
3218	I don't see any kids at all. It's like they ditched me in advance.
3219	I'm a screw-up. I burned down our house.
3220	Why are all his laundry basket shots three point attempts?
3221	"Hi David, I'm Grampa."
3222	"Oh, oh, thank the Lord! He's truly watching over--"
3223	"Myth: Cable piracy is wrong. Fact: Cable companies are big faceless corporations, which makes it okay."
3224	"Right. Right, nothing."
3225	"Or like when... I got nothin'. Uh, let's just find that piece."
3226	You could deliver newspapers.
3227	"Homer, before you get anywhere near the escalator, you've got to tie those shoes. Homer!"
3228	Hmmm... Interesting theory.
3229	"It's like five classrooms in one! A science room... student lounge... mathnasium... An experimental theater! All set for a production of Samuel Beckett's ""Endgame""!"
3230	"Now, kids, we all know that sometimes when cartoon characters die, they're back again the very next week. That's why I'm presenting this sworn affidavit that Poochie will never, ever, ever return."
3231	Hi kids! Welcome to Kamp Krusty!
3232	"Slow down, boy. What's your hurry?"
3233	There are too many leaves in your walkway!
3234	"Consulates are regional offices, which serve the embassy in the capital."
3235	"Look, Dad. I missed you so much, I couldn't concentrate in school and I got an ""F""."
3236	"Hi-dilly ho, Simpsons!"
3237	Perhaps we should just call the police.
3238	Finally! Actual science!
3239	"You like 'em, huh? Come on, I'll show you the other three hundred."
3240	"You're safe now, my friend."
3241	"Excuse me? Better? Thanks a lot, Marge, you really put me in my place."
3242	"That's right, he did. Excuse me, but Dr. Hibbert has been our family physician for years, and he thought Bart was fine."
3243	"You know it's gonna be bad, but you just can't prepare yourself."
3244	"Your mom's doing laundry, but she authorized me to say goodnight for her. So, by the power vested in me, I now pronounce you sweet dreams."
3245	"Man, this is taking forever. I know how to speed things up."
3246	"Krusty, you know her?"
3247	"Homer, did you know he was in the pile?"
3248	"No, no. I want to be alone with my thought."
3249	"Oh, why do we have to play this lousy old game?"
3250	"Get ready, skanks -- here comes the truth train!"
3251	"Ten and two, Einstein!"
3252	All camping is pointless. You drive hundreds of miles to shower and sleep in a place with no bathroom or beds. I guess what I'm trying to say is: where's Maggie?
3253	"Homer, that's our wedding photo."
3254	"Ah, sir, at last the world will see you as I always have."
3255	"Darcy, in fifty years, you might see me walking down the street and you'll wonder, ""Is that Bart?"" And I'll go and you'll know."
3256	Maybe we should just call it a night.
3257	"A hungry, hungry hippo!"
3258	"Dad, I loved it, too, but it was seven years ago."
3259	"Ha, ha, you lose! 36 and 239!"
3260	"Homer, fall backward!"
3261	While Bart turned out so wonderful in his own way!
3262	I NEED SOME MONEY / A LOT OF MONEY... AHH
3263	"Ah, I tell ya the way these checks keep coming in, it's almost criminal."
3264	"Ah, the family car... we've been through a lot together..."
3265	"Okay, fish, you're probably wondering why I'm still here. Catching you will make me the most famous fisherman there is, right up there with... that... the a... bald guy on that cable fishing show."
3266	"Okay, we've got cocktail wienies and Swedish meatballs."
3267	"I don't get it. Football players can do the quarterback sneak, and baseball players can steal bases. Why can't I just remember which cards have been played?"
3268	"Fellow workers, I've been meeting with Mr. Burns day and night and I've had enough."
3269	"Oh. Usually, Milhouse does it."
3270	Ooops. Time for a fill-up. GarÃ§on! Another bottle of your second-least-expensive champagne.
3271	I'll give you five dollars for it.
3272	"Moe, the new Duff calendars are out! The ones with your picture!"
3273	"Anti-trust suit... anti-trust suit... A note from Marge Simpson? Well, isn't that a coincidence? I was just thinking about her..."
3274	"Bart, why are you still up?"
3275	"The only reason Lisa won is because she learned to think like a boy! I turned her into a burping, farting, bullying, math machine!"
3276	"Listen, do you know this man?"
3277	"You know, there are only so many times I can say I'm sorry and still mean it!"
3278	And you will be a dancer.
3279	I'm not pouting. I'm... mourning. Stupid dead woman.
3280	"Stop that, Bart. Homer, speak to him."
3281	He's circling the Shelbyville Bird Sanctuary.
3282	Larry? Larry? Larry? Larryyyy?!
3283	"Because if you feel you have to put what you are on your shirt, then I feel sorry for you. Do you feel sorry for me? Guess not."
3284	"So what brings you to Springfield, Mr. Musk?"
3285	"Quiet, honey. Daddy's asking the man a question."
3286	I wonder what this could be?
3287	"I'm just glad you all finally saw what an amazing human being I am. Now, where's the nearest place I can score a little victory weed?"
3288	No fair! You only won 'cause you had the inside track! If the water was spinning the other way--
3289	"Boy, I sure could go for a hundred tacos right about now."
3290	"E'll-shay uy-bay em-thay, upid-stay."
3291	"Very well, begin the thawing of Jim Nabors."
3292	"You got a letter too, Bart."
3293	Maybe it's time to put him in one where he can't get out.
3294	Did you spend this whole time doing fake chores in a fake village?
3295	They hanged him for murder and buried him in an unmarked grave. When they came back the next day... the whole cemetery was missing.
3296	"Only ten dollars to paint my curb like a common whore? Well I'm happy to pay for a three-digit spray! Tell you what, I'll give you another hundred if you paint my garage!"
3297	"Um, on second thought, boy, why don't you take my chair?"
3298	"Hey, that was a fast count!"
3299	"Hmm, that's odd. Usually the blood gets off at the second floor."
3300	"Oh, Bart, cartoons don't have to be one hundred percent realistic."
3301	"That's it, Moe. This is just too weird. You are not allowed to see Maggie anymore."
3302	"COCOA! ""Ice rink drink!"""
3303	"Cut it off, but be careful."
3304	So there's a chance I actually won! I've got to dig up that ballot box!
3305	"I've heard that from co-workers, strangers on the street, even my own children... but I never thought I'd hear it from you."
3306	I've gotta save them.
3307	Last night I dreamed I held you in my arms.
3308	What's the big deal? He sees a thousand times worse on that animal channel.
3309	"Hey, swabby. You've missed spots there... and another one there... and there... Every other spot is begrimed!"
3310	"But it's funny, Marge. The guy's sick."
3311	If you call this living.
3312	Snow. God's cotton candy.
3313	Dad took us antiquing!
3314	"Come on, Chief. I can't afford to pay protection to you and Nelson."
3315	I wonder who that could... beeee!
3316	"Please stay calm, everyone."
3317	You're probably right.
3318	"Mmmm. Marge, Could you get me another beer, please?"
3319	"You see? Hey, what are you looking at?"
3320	Fine. Eight weeks off... with pay.
3321	"Marge, I don't want to die with us mad at each other."
3322	"You stopped being my Daddy as soon as you bet against me! All I have now is a mom, which is why I'm taking her maiden name! From now on, I'm..."
3323	Sure it will. All we need is a pilot!
3324	"Hey, that's a half truth."
3325	"Hey boy, where'd you get that hat?"
3326	Don't you know smoking stunts your growth?
3327	"Homer, you're going to get in trouble."
3328	I'm safe as long as nothing disturbs this incredibly delicate balance.
3329	"If you're suggesting I stayed up all night trying to solve that childish puzzle, you're right."
3330	Can I draw a robot barfing screws on your arm with my Sharpie?
3331	"Attaboy! I knew you'd come! Gimme a kiss! Oh, yeah!"
3332	"Lemme set the scene for you, Marge."
3333	"Uh, yeah, me. I use it all the time."
3334	Hurry up and kill it! I have to be at the opera by seven!
3335	"Look, lady, we've seen the Crappy Little Elves about fourteen billion times. Maybe we can watch some real TV."
3336	"It is to me! Marge, I can't live like this! I'm tired of walking around on eggshells."
3337	Milhouse abandoned me.
3338	You wanted to get caught.
3339	"Okay, this is gettin' weird."
3340	"Oh, geez. Not this guy, with his stupid little pushcart."
3341	"Mr. Burns, is there anything at all I can do for you?"
3342	"Let's see, he's forty years old, times twenty-five grand... Whoaa, he's a millionaire!"
3343	"Yes, you'll be completely above the law. Uh, women, guns, cash, uh, whatever you need -- it's yours."
3344	Cause I sure haven't.
3345	"Hey, as long as they're not hurting anybody."
3346	You are invited to... a grand gesture? Oooh!
3347	You'll always have Bart. Always.
3348	"So, any dirt on the new teacher?"
3349	"Don't be a sap, Dad. These are just crappy knock-offs."
3350	"I have a plan to deal with that. Step one: change everything about ourselves until we are super cool, the end."
3351	Maggie! Why'd you do that?
3352	"Oh, little chipmunk friend. I'm allergic to everything!"
3353	And he taught me how to do this.
3354	"What is troubling you, my son? I mean, my girl son?"
3355	There you are! You can help me spray the cookies...
3356	"Dad, are you listening to me?"
3357	"Well, okay then... ... Four o'clock... Coupla hours I have to get up and go to work... gotta go to work... go to work."
3358	Is this the Dairy Queen?
3359	HELP! HELP! FIRE!... ... helmets.
3360	Maybe death will stop your yammering!
3361	"Well, looks like we got everything for Bart's camping trip: Blair Witch Repellent, antler saw and Deep Woods Scrabble."
3362	"Oh, son. You know that's none of your business. Say, is that our house?"
3363	"Eat around the banana, Dad, it's just empty vitamins."
3364	"Well, when monsoon season comes, you'll be glad it's there."
3365	Take the sob sister act somewhere else -- you're standin' in my light!
3366	What about your own children?
3367	"Your daughterly love saved me, sweetie!"
3368	"Yeah, they're great. Little clingy... but anyway, this Springfield primary election -- pretty crazy, huh?"
3369	Not my Monet! I only looked at it once!
3370	"Uh, now that you mention it, we could use..."
3371	"Yeah, you always do. Well, here's where to meet us..."
3372	"Well, that's just the way dogs are. The most disloyal unfaithful creatures God ever made."
3373	"Sweetie, don't worry. I'm gonna come back so horny and angry..."
3374	Fine. I'll come back later. Who wants to come back with me? Fine.
3375	"Come, family, sit in the snow with Daddy and let us all bask in television's warm glowing, warming glow."
3376	That's not as fun as it looks.
3377	"More Vicodin and eggs, please."
3378	I never want to see you again! You either!
3379	I came to get my mail.
3380	They cut out the best word!
3381	"When Willie asked me to be a presenter at the New Awareness Awards, I had to think about it... for about a microsecond."
3382	"Hey, maybe Chalmers would let you guys sit in on our lessons. After me, men!"
3383	BART WAS FEELING MIGHTY BLUE...
3384	Woo hoo! A flyer for a hardware store!
3385	We're actually entering Dad's dreams?
3386	"Okay... okay... okay... okay... okay... okay... okay. Okay, you're saying that Ned and me married you two?"
3387	"Oh, Puppy Goo Goo, fetch me a dream."
3388	"Geez, how many gazebos do you she-males need?"
3389	"Will you shut up, I'm trying to think of a name."
3390	"You have the right to be delighted. If you do not have a gift, one will be provided for you."
3391	"Marge, I never put my foot down about anything."
3392	Yess... that was Bonita De Wolf and the Springfield Nuclear Plant Soft Shoe Society.
3393	I simply can't wait that long. Maybe we should get some help... How 'bout a book?
3394	"Look, everyone knows that cigarettes are where flavor lives and a cool choice for a hot night. But they're for losers!"
3395	He sure is neurotic for a monster.
3396	"Come on you schnorers, do something!"
3397	"You know, Mr. Burns, you're the richest guy I know. Way richer than Lenny."
3398	"Homer, please pay attention. There's just one more movie."
3399	Can you keep her quiet?
3400	How can we forget? Mom says now we can't afford to go to the orthodontist.
3401	"Aw, that's sweet. Here's all the money we would've given to televangelists."
3402	Matador Juan Belmonte!
3403	"What do we owe you, Moe?"
3404	"Thank you! And remember: Don't trust anyone over thirty. And now, Peter Frampton!"
3405	I never realized how boring this game is.
3406	"Thanks, Dad. But you're so loud it's hurting my ears."
3407	"Oh, yeah, I got that."
3408	"Just give the word, and I'll cut him off."
3409	"I'm coming with you. I got you fired, it's the least I can do... Well, the least I can do is absolutely nothing. But I'll go you one better and come along."
3410	"Milhouse, you'll probably think this is lame, but I was gonna go for a nature walk after school and I thought maybe you'd like to..."
3411	They're not juicy. My licks are dry. Dry and scratchy like a cat's tongue.
3412	I'm here to break a world record. What's the longest anyone's ever done this?
3413	"Marge, I'm pullin' an all-nighter for my little girl. Put on a pot of coffee, drink it and start makin' burgers."
3414	"You know, Marge, for the first time in our marriage, I can finally look down my nose at you. You have a gambling problem."
3415	"Outtasight! Lay it on me, Mama."
3416	Aunt Bella! Wait a minute. I got a call on the other line. Michael Jackson!
3417	"Homer, the ship's upside down and hundreds of people are dead!"
3418	"Marge, sweetie, do you know how low, low prices are ""insane?"" Well, sometimes people can be too."
3419	Bonk it. Twist it. Smack it.
3420	Nooo! My Spine-O-Cylinder!
3421	"High as a kite, everybody! Goofballs--"
3422	"Sir, that's by Homer Simpson. I don't think you want to buy it."
3423	Poor Bambi... poor Thumper...
3424	"Whoa, you blood-sucking freaks love your kids too?"
3425	Do you want to spend your whole life doing what's right?
3426	"Oh, Milhouse! You're very brave."
3427	"I've won every coin. But I feel strangely empty. Ooh, there's another coin. That should do it."
3428	Me? But I'm the father.
3429	"Yeah, spill your guts, man."
3430	"Aw, where's your sense of humor?"
3431	What a wing ding. This is much better than my girlfriend's birthday party.
3432	"Well, we could bike to the tea shop and have some cake."
3433	"Oh God, they're in our food! Teddy Grahams, Gummi Bears..."
3434	"Oh uh, Teeny here is from Brazil. His uncle was the head monkey at the Bureau of Tourism."
3435	"Now Ms. Bobbins, if you want this job you're going to have to answer a few questions. First, do you have any bad habits?"
3436	"Oh, it was delightful. The frosting on the cake was this thick. And Eugene Fisk, my poor sucker of an assistant, didn't know the fruit punch was spiked. And he really made an ass of himself putting the moves on the new girl in Valve Maintenance."
3437	"Oh, right as rain. Or, as we say around here, left as rain."
3438	"No, no. I'm pretty sure he's with Milhouse."
3439	You must've found out about my letters. They were just a joke.
3440	Sweet. Now I'm gonna need some wheels.
3441	"Well, your training wheels come off your bike."
3442	So I guess the lesson here is...
3443	"What are you saying, Honey?"
3444	Maybe you wouldn't be such a bad president.
3445	"Homer, drive defensively."
3446	I know! And I don't want him to stray from anything except his diet. And I don't really want him to do that.
3447	"Dough, sauce, cheese, topping. Dough, sauce, cheese, topping. Dough, sauce, cheese, topping! Having fun, Maggie?"
3448	"Kids, I made some lemonade for you."
3449	"Lisa, I'm sure this Wiggum-arole will blow over -- you have to have faith in the wisdom of the average voter."
3450	"Homer Simpson, Sir. One of the fork- and-spoon operators from Sector 7G."
3451	"You can have the shower to yourself, Homie. I'm finished."
3452	"No arguments here. Man, I really come off like a jerk in this thing."
3453	"That's my girl. You just go home, and don't worry your pretty blue head about it. Moe will take care of everything."
3454	"And so handsome! Bart, I just love him!"
3455	Who designed this house?!
3456	"Of course I can twist it, I'm great."
3457	But it's all worth it just to hear him sing.
3458	"I'll take that, you stinkpot! Just warming up, Mrs. Bloominstein."
3459	This is like some beautiful dream.
3460	That's not true! It's just a rumor! You're engaged in speculation. I know the law. You can't prove anything.
3461	"Li-sa, I can't imagine anyone being more likable than you. But apparently this new girl is. So my advice would be to start copying her in every way."
3462	"Yes, well, I'm older than you. You know, Simpson, you're not as objectionable as you seemed when we first met."
3463	It's hard to see what's going on. I can only make out the fat soldiers.
3464	"We've gotta get Marge some professional training. Carl, do you know heavyweight champ Drederick Tatum?"
3465	Don't you mean present?
3466	I died when Homer sat on me!
3467	"Could I have shot Mr. Burns in a drunken rage? No. No, not me. I know in my heart I..."
3468	"My Bar Mitzvah cake! Oy, I'll never be a man!"
3469	"Lisa, can you come down?"
3470	I'm writing a delicious send up of Mr. Burns for his birthday party. Is poo poo one word or two?
3471	"Oh, Homer, would you please help me make a big deal of this?"
3472	You didn't need to knock the food on the floor.
3473	You lied to me! Release the hounds!
3474	"Yeah, I was boastful before all your football show-boaters, rap music-ers, and TV beach Italians. But there was a downside to being hated... being hated."
3475	"Find anything this time, boys?"
3476	"Okay, just let me clear some space."
3477	"Uh, sir, we've found the problem. Some idiot threw this in the reactor core."
3478	"Okay, so I committed a little mail fraud. Haven't I been punished enough?"
3479	Can you describe the bill?
3480	"Well, the ownership is divided."
3481	"Except when pronounced like ""a,"" as in ""neighbor"" and ""weigh."""
3482	"Homer, did you jimmy open Mr. Burns' liquor cabinet?"
3483	It's too early to call shotgun!
3484	"Stampy! Stampy! Where are you, boy?"
3485	WORTH IT TO BE RI-IGHT! WORTH IT TO BE RI-IGHT!
3486	"THEY BURNED DOWN THE GAMBLING HOUSE - IT DIED WITH AN AWFUL SOUND / I AM HUNGRY FOR A CAN-DY BAR / I THINK I'LL EAT A ""MOUNDS""..."
3487	"Yuh-huh, that's the deal. No more exercise program! No more traffic! No more blood drives or charity walks!"
3488	"Sorry, man. Be my guest."
3489	"This whole thing is silly. I mean, isn't the idea of one person taking credit for an entire movie the stupidest thing you ever heard?"
3490	"Woo hoo! Three hundred fifty dollars!! Now I can buy seventy transcripts of ""Nightline""!"
3491	"No, no, no. You think this is about money? Well, it's not. It's worse, Marge. I'm afraid that from now on when I look at you, I'm not gonna see the wife by my side or the mother of my children. I'm just gonna see the dame who blew my one big chance."
3492	"It never spins the other way. In the Northern hemisphere, water always drains counter-clockwise. It's called the Coriolis effect."
3493	"All right, I'll be the stupid curtain puller."
3494	But that wouldn't happen unless...
3495	Of our marriage?! I don't want to live!
3496	Give me another chance. I'll be way more attentive to your needs on the seesaw -- I'll stay down there for as long as you want.
3497	"Oh Marge, once again you've taken one of my screw-ups and turned it into food. Man, if only you could do that with Bart."
3498	"Thanks for the lift, Tony Hawk. I've gotta go now, Tony Hawk."
3499	"I'm afraid I'd just be repeating myself, honey. Anyway, other people need to use the phone."
3500	I can't believe I destroyed the Earth.
3501	"Come on Marge, we're mad at 'im."
3502	"Well, I've learned the robotic worker is no match for the old-fashioned man of labor. You're all hired back... as temps!"
3503	Still no visitors! It's time we opened up a can of whup-tushy on this situation. What's the number for Luigi's?
3504	"Hey, cut that out! I have an idea."
3505	A hundred and six thousand dollars?
3506	"Homie, I don't mean to nag, but what does this have to do with healing your eyes?"
3507	"Homie, I missed you so much! Put your pants back on."
3508	Embarrassed? What are you talking about?
3509	"Oh, I don't know how to punish you! What does Marge usually do?"
3510	"Oh boy! / All right, free money! / Wow!"
3511	"Hmmm, a cow on a farm... With a moo moo here, and a moo moo there... Yes, it works!"
3512	I want to talk to Howard.
3513	"Marge, it's not the money. My job is my identity. If I'm not a safety whatchamajigger, I'm nothing."
3514	I am holding still. I am squirming.
3515	"Please, FBI man, don't throw us in jail. We just made one mistake."
3516	All the answers you need are in here. Happy anniversary!
3517	"I'm gonna put a spell on you! Yes I am, my tuna-breath familiar."
3518	Marge... ix-nay on the ash-hole-tray.
3519	What is it? What is it? What is it?
3520	Nothin'. What's your hurry?
3521	"Well, for the first time in my life I feel that someone understands..."
3522	"Ohhhhhh. That's brilliant, Professor! What will you think of next?"
3523	You can start with the rinse!
3524	"Actually, Dad, it's the smallest tax increase in history."
3525	D'OH D'OH D'OH D'OH D'OH D'OH D'OH / WOO WOO WOO WOO WOO WOO HOO / STU STU STU STU-PID FLANDERS...
3526	You're right! I gotta get where the action is!
3527	But we saw your plane crash...
3528	"Okay, I'm coming right out the door. Dammit! These windows are so hard to squeeze through!"
3529	I wish to announce the formation of PPASSCCATAG: Proud Parents Against Singles Seniors Childless Couples and Teens And Gays.
3530	"Here's a headline for Jay. ""Ketchup Truck Hits Hamburger Stand."""
3531	"Brave Odysseus, it has been twenty long years. Regale me with tales of your adventures."
3532	U.S.A.! U.S.A.! U.S.--
3533	You're siding with record companies?
3534	Let's get outta here!
3535	You're gonna eat a blizzard of...
3536	This is Marge Simpson. I'd like a babysitter for the evening.
3537	"I thought I'd never have to do this, but it's time to tell you the facts of life."
3538	"With a little middle relief, they might even make the playoffs."
3539	"Wait a minute, Skinner. How do we know some principal over in France isn't pulling the same scam you are?"
3540	"Sounds delicious. It's not. Hey, a friend of mine, uh, bought a painting here."
3541	"Oh, this is a parent's worst nightmare! They've stolen a car and they're home alone."
3542	"Um Mom, maybe you shouldn't have put so much syrup on the pancakes."
3543	"It's green, moron. Earth to stupid guy, hullo? Maybe a little friendly punching will move your ass."
3544	"My gold is in the heart of every freedom-loving American.,my gold is in the heart of every freedom-loving american,10"
3545	You're just a sweet guy from Springfield who wanted his family to have a better life.
3546	"Becky, what have I done here? I'm so sorry."
3547	"Let's go, kids. I can't watch any more."
3548	"Now, I know I haven't been the best... aw, forget it."
3549	"Well, once he found out we were going to get Ned Flanders fired, he insisted on helping."
3550	"Not yet, son. Not yet."
3551	"Here you are, sir. Wild raspberry compote, celery root remoulade, and pheasant under duck. I hope you enjoy it."
3552	You're going to Stanford! You're going to Stanford!
3553	Adil! Oh... there you are.
3554	"So, this is my Krusty doll, Funzo, Linguo, Iraq War Sergeant Activity with insufficient armor, Phonic Frog, cat skull, Jim Halterman bobble-head doll -- he's a local car dealer..."
3555	"I'm just saying, why not have two geniuses in the family? Sort of a spare in case Bart's brain blows up."
3556	I can't. My Mom's not picking me up for an hour.
3557	What are you doing?! You're indoors at an outdoor party!
3558	All because of a bunch of stuff that happened.
3559	"Guys, quit telling the truth!"
3560	"Hmmm. This looks like a nice, friendly place."
3561	You don't fight like a girl! Or even a Milhouse!
3562	"I know what you're up to, Mayor Terwigajer. And no one in my family's gonna stand for it!"
3563	What's so good about it?
3564	"Yeah! Maybe I should spend the night here, too."
3565	How did you wind up here?
3566	"Well, for only five dollars you can sock it to him in style!"
3567	"Yeah, and I'm Clobbersaurus."
3568	"But I think I'm allergic to seafood. The last time I ate shrimp, my throat closed up and I went into convulsions."
3569	"This could come in handy. But let me check that list of things Marge said never to bring home. Dogs, cats, octopuses, octopi, octopuseseses..."
3570	"Yeah. And who the hell are you talkin' to? Marge, do you have other men in this house? Radioactive men?"
3571	Okay. Do I have to do anything?
3572	"Oh, like I'm gonna kick Chief Wiggum in the groin."
3573	What about the duty-free stuff we bought?
3574	Is there a voodoo queen you can direct me to?
3575	"Yes, it's something, dear."
3576	"We did it, Bart! I'm a mentor!"
3577	"Sorry, boy, I have to get enough to help everybody."
3578	Did Frank Lloyd Wright have to deal with people like you?
3579	Are you kidding? Lisa turned out perfect. I won't stand here and listen to you bad-mouthing Lisa!
3580	"That's some nice work, Simpson. But um, we can't hold him, there's no evidence."
3581	"Well... sure. We'll have to move a chair in from the den, but it's no problem. Bart!"
3582	Then we heard a loud crash...we were tempted to scat...
3583	"No! No, no, no! It was me that couldn't get to--"
3584	Those jets keep going lower and lower.
3585	"My God, you're right, Marge. You kids wouldn't put me in a home like I did to my dad, would you?"
3586	"Wow, it's so fancy. It's like Moby's house on ""Cribs""!"
3587	"No one man can do all that. You're a liar, honey. A dirty, rotten liar."
3588	"Well, he better high-five our roof!"
3589	Hippie Lady I wanna get out.
3590	Maybe. I'm not sure. I forgot it.
3591	"No! No, not the iodine! Burn the germs off with a torch, amputate my arm, but not the -- YAAAUUUGGGHHH!"
3592	"Huh, they both make a good case."
3593	All right ladies -- get ready to settle!
3594	Only if it lasts forever.
3595	"Shut up, brain, or I'll stab you with a Q-tip."
3596	Their drunken singing is ruining St. Patrick's day!
3597	Bart! Turn away from that screen and look out the window!
3598	"Bart, I'm so sorry. I just wanted to ruin his life, not end it."
3599	Oh Marge! I still hurt! Marge! Marge!
3600	Dad's been doing that for two hours!
3601	"Oh, when did you buy that novelty hand, sir?"
3602	"L is for ""loser,"" which describes you, sir. Don't try to stop me. Just enjoy the view, sir."
3603	I hope you're not planning to see a certain movie starring certain space mutants that a certain mother didn't want you to see?
3604	"Dad, I'm tired of bathing in the yard. Plus, I think Rod and Todd are watching."
3605	That's so fake. That's so fake. I don't know how they-- Too real!
3606	I thought it was about her boobs.
3607	I'm just a little girl.
3608	Well no one else seems to share the same spirit of camaraderie.
3609	All you have to do is sign this form.
3610	"Um, okay, I've really really really learned my lesson. Can I please go now?"
3611	"Yeah, even with all his problems, he's still willing to do something unbelievably dangerous just to entertain his fans."
3612	"Hm, bottle-nose bruises, blowhole burns... flipper prints... this looks like the work of rowdy teens. Lou, cancel the prom."
3613	Sweetie... did you ever think of doing something a little more creative with your time?
3614	And here I am using my own lungs like a sucker! And how come everyone gets a bedpan and I have to walk all the way over there?
3615	"Whoa, whoa, slow down there, maestro. There's a New Mexico?"
3616	And a ooga-booga to you too.
3617	"Well, here's one dollar those crooks aren't gonna get their hands on."
3618	"Oh, you're the bee's knees, baby. I missed you bad."
3619	The school's having a bake sale today! At three o'clock!
3620	"Ooo, everything's changed! That tree used to be a smaller tree. And that food bank used to be a regular bank."
3621	"Okay look, there's a big football game on tonight, so we can get this thing over real quick. Show me some of Bart's artwork, give me a little false hope, and here's a little something to help with his grades."
3622	But we're already on chapter seven.
3623	"Squeak, squeak, squeak. No, don't kiss me."
3624	"C'mon, we're gonna be late to the blooming of the Sumatran Century Flower."
3625	Their teacher takes her shoes off!
3626	"That's it! That's it! My nightmare is over! Oh Flanders, you are my personal savior!"
3627	I can't let the boy see me skipping work.
3628	"This is great! And all I've done is enter my name! ""Thrillhouse!"""
3629	"Oh, he's sunk even lower!"
3630	"Heh, heh. This is a tasty little lager that came all the way from Holland."
3631	Apparently not feisty enough. Future generations will judge us by how we cared for the tiniest creatures. I am not just asking you to save the bees. I am asking you to save your souls.
3632	What did I miss? How did it end?
3633	Okay. Umm... automatic...
3634	"Homer, are you going to the Duff Brewery?"
3635	Why can't you be a little more supportive?
3636	"So, you fought all those robots?"
3637	"For one thing, there are too many fat children."
3638	"Hey, don't worry Barney. It's a big school. There's gotta be a girl nobody else wants to take to the prom."
3639	"And worst of all, you took the ""Hamburglar's"" birthday off last Monday and Wednesday! Which is it? Now, my voice is giving out, so I'm just going to poke you for the next hour or so."
3640	"Oh, it shows! I haven't had a strangle that smooth since I was four."
3641	So I started it myself.
3642	"Um, I was married once, but uh, I just didn't know how to keep it together."
3643	And I won't rest until I've gotten a hot dog.
3644	"I don't know, Sir. You had sex with that old woman?"
3645	Can I help you with that?
3646	"Hey, he went into a construction site!"
3647	"Dad, I know you think you're happy now, but it's not gonna last forever."
3648	"These people are always grinding against each other, and I think they're all related. I wish we'd never come."
3649	"So I said to him, ""Look buddy, your car was upside down when we got here. And as for your Grandma, she shouldn't have mouthed off like that."""
3650	"All right! Now you've got all the Simpsons behind you, Apu!"
3651	Spin the middle side topwise. Topwise.
3652	"Okay, Bart went to the comic book store."
3653	Drugs! Various drugs! Be sure to read instructions! Uh-oh! Where'd I put the instructions?
3654	"Look at this little plastic couple. Mmm, so full of hopes, potential, dreams for the future..."
3655	"But I'm only two hundred dollars short of fourteen thousand, eight hundred dollars."
3656	"Again, I maintain that money would be better spent on car insurance."
3657	"All thanks to... ""The Answer""!"
3658	Didn't there used to be more Texxon stations?
3659	"Guess what, Sideshow Mel? It's time for Itchy & Scratchy!"
3660	So you don't miss that politics lady at all?
3661	"Why am I in the basement? Shouldn't I see a medico? If the Wilson's calf is birthed, Doc Miller should be available."
3662	"That's great, sweetie. After all that time and hard work, I'll have... radishes?! It's the most hated part of salad, which is the most hated part of dinner! Radishes. Nothing but radishes."
3663	Where's all your Krusty stuff?
3664	"What's that, Sideshow Bob? This is Brittany and today's her birthday?"
3665	Okay. I can handle that.
3666	"Lisa, I'm not scared. I think it's a great chance to spend some time with you kids. Your mother always gets to be alone with you, and now it's my turn. Does the time always drag like this?"
3667	"Okay, they're useful on me."
3668	Like I say night after night after night: nighty-night.
3669	"I would feel: A). Happy for their good fortune, B). Proud to know rich people, and C). Grateful for an opportunity to learn from a mistake."
3670	"Bart, you can hear us?"
3671	"Well, do something! This is all your fault. You and your stupid program."
3672	And there's nothing wrong with hitting someone when his back is turned.
3673	How about groin-grabbingly transcendent?
3674	"Dad, you fought tooth and nail to get it away from our house."
3675	"Oh Michael, one bite of this soufflÃ© and your father will realize your gift deserves to flower."
3676	"I'm starving! Somebody bring me some food, quick!"
3677	"Neddie, Neddie... Let's get in a quick nine down at the pitch and putt."
3678	Who said it was a he?
3679	"HomeIE, I can't quite..."
3680	I don't wanna leave! You promised me I could die here!
3681	Would you lasso me a banana?
3682	"So, Flanders, have you sold anything?"
3683	"Look at that beautiful garbage! Other cities don't want it, so they pay me to dump it in this old abandoned mine."
3684	"Remember Springfield, keep on swinging!"
3685	Don't worry your spiky little head. I've got it all planned out.
3686	"Three? You mean, one, two... me?"
3687	Or swindling our neighbors.
3688	Better leave it to the professionals.
3689	"Table Five, Table Five..."
3690	It's almost like she's alive again.
3691	"You know, some of these stories are pretty good. I never know mice lived such interesting lives."
3692	"Who could it be? A disgruntled former employee? Whoever it is, the cobra is their symbol."
3693	The Terrifying Callback!
3694	But I had a large soda!
3695	"Ooh, I like that. Now, I'd like to try something new if you don't mind..."
3696	What do we do next? What do we do next?
3697	"Mr. Burns, you brought us a present."
3698	"Relax, Marge. This'll all blow over."
3699	I told them it was a benefit. They think they're saving the rainforest.
3700	"Lisa rocks, and so does her rock collection."
3701	I'm standin' right here!
3702	What about that two-headed goat?
3703	"Who are ""they,"" exactly?"
3704	"Wordplay: never cared for it. But it's never too soon for you two to join the ""I do"" crew. Now I'm not sayin' it's all Jell-O with Cool Whip. She'll nag ya. She'll try to change ya. You'll be fighting the same basic fight for years and years and years--"
3705	"With the mighty tongue God's given you, why can't you speak kindly of these imperfect angels?"
3706	"Bart, maybe you should listen to this."
3707	"No. Because they're efficient and punctual, with a strong work ethic."
3708	"Come here. ""YOU ARE SO BEAUTIFUL TO ME / YOU ARE SO BEAUTIFUL TO ME / CAN'T YOU SEE? / YOU'RE EVERYTHING THAT I HOPED FOR /"
3709	"There's something troubling me, Dad...but I don't think I can tell you because it's a secret."
3710	Nothing... must... take... test.
3711	"What a lovely surprise! You're here to see me, right?"
3712	"Oh, Simpson. You do know how to whip my buggy."
3713	"This? Oh, it's just fluid collecting."
3714	You're an undercover cop?
3715	"That's better. Now, let's role... play!"
3716	...And the floor was donated by American Superball.
3717	Oh boy. Let's get out of here before Dad does a bad impression of Mom.
3718	All this senseless violence. I don't understand its appeal.
3719	"Say, that's right. This is your first visit to the Flanders homestead."
3720	"Oh, that's cute. Did you get it in the souvenir shop?"
3721	You think that's traumatic.
3722	A little lazy if you ask me.
3723	"Now, Homer, I know what you're thinking and I want to take the pressure off."
3724	"Your Honor, if I may sing a little bit of ""Don't Fear the Reaper"", I think you'll agree that..."
3725	"Well, it's not fair when Moleman uses his replacement legs."
3726	Just a statue? Is the Statue of Liberty just a statue? Is the Leaning Tower of Piza just a statue?
3727	"That's it! I'll make money with a chauffeur job. Good thing you turned on that TV, Lisa."
3728	Night will come soon.
3729	"Well, maybe we could order something from Oak Ridge..."
3730	"Mrs. Simpson, while we were rescuing your husband, a lumberyard burned down."
3731	"Lisa, a guy who has lots of ivory is less likely to hurt Stampy than a guy whose ivory supplies are low."
3732	"Oh, yeah? My left arm says different."
3733	"Homie, I've been thinking. We have been using this TV for a long time. So I entered a contest where the first prize is a plasma screen TV."
3734	"But then, you've always been proud of me."
3735	"Oh, I knew that one, too."
3736	Now you got a law suit on your hands. Just kidding.
3737	"Marge, that's what I bought it for!"
3738	"Ooh. Clean up. Now don't worry, everybody, this'll be a breeze if we all pitch in."
3739	"Don't worry, son -- no one's gonna make you count to twenty. I have a more humane solution."
3740	My head feels like it was punched by a boxing man.
3741	Grampa's driving me crazy!
3742	You heard the monkey -- make the trade.
3743	You're going to ask her to marry you?!
3744	"Thank you, honey, for opening my eyes."
3745	"What? What are you talking about? Clearly make sense, man. I can't understand a word you're saying. You're just babbling incoherently like some sort of..."
3746	Quiet! It's time for the noblest Nobel Prize of all: the Peace Prize.
3747	"I could crush him like an ant, but it would be too easy. No, revenge is a dish best served cold. I'll bide my time until... Oh, what the hell. I'll just crush him like an ant."
3748	"I put you in humiliating commercials for money, which I spent on myself. I just wish I had an opportunity to make things right."
3749	"Now, why don't you listen to the musical stylings of Mr. Lionel Richie."
3750	We can still make the kickoff!
3751	"Oy, oy. Stop it. This bit's dyin'. Let's go to the Mad Marge Dancers."
3752	These are all fast food jobs.
3753	I don't have a blue shirt.
3754	"Homer, Bart's at a very curious age. As his father, I think you should have a frank and earthy discussion about...hmmm, you know."
3755	"I had to fight! Lenny said his dad is Hulk Hogan, and I know he's not!"
3756	I'm edgy! I got ants in my pants! I'm discombobulated! Get me a calmative!
3757	There's a crayon in my brain?!
3758	Boy! Push down on the bumper! Then I can back the car up and save myself.
3759	Shower you with love because this experience has taught me just how precious you are.
3760	Oh yeah? How dumb do you think I --
3761	Somebody stop the fight! Where's the doctor?!
3762	Wicca's a Hollywood fad!
3763	"Helmets are for wusses, Sir."
3764	"Hmmm, well, you've cooled down."
3765	Maggie! Cut that racket!
3766	"Here are some supervised activities we can all do together. Future Veterans of Foreign Wars, The 5-H Club..."
3767	"Dad, we're the visitors."
3768	"Aww. There, there, boy. I'll help you get him back. He may have been a dirty, stinkin' coward, but show me a Simpson that isn't."
3769	I hate that lousy dean!
3770	I AM A LINEMAN FOR THE COUNTY Your call is important to us. Please continue to hold. AND I DRIVE THE MAIN ROAD There are... eight... calls ahead of you. AND THE WICHITA LINEMAN IS STILL ON THE LI-LI-LI-LI-LI-LI-LI-LI-LI-LI-LI-LI-LI-LI-LI-LI-LI-LI-LI-LI-LI-LI-LINE!
3771	Good Lord! What have those little hellions done now?
3772	"My old one's fine, but ya never know."
3773	"Leave him alone, you vultures!"
3774	Fine. Let me just get my harness pads.
3775	These'll go great with betel nut butter!
3776	I need something for Show and Tell.
3777	I didn't think you'd understand.
3778	Sell! Sell! Sell! Woo hoo! Twenty-five dollars!
3779	"Tickets, please. Hey, where's your ticket? Leave me alone! Why you little..."
3780	"Yeah, let's play bingo!"
3781	"Marge, there're so many mysteries that I need to have solved."
3782	"Stupid books. Hey, a cupcake."
3783	"Lisa, I have this strong unpleasant feeling I've never had before."
3784	When I look at you -- all I see are the foibles that drive your women crazy! Foibles! Foibles! FOIBLES!
3785	Patty! Selma! We're home.
3786	"But, but I wasn't... I didn't..."
3787	"Oh, I hope ""plunging"" means ""up,"" and ""seventy-five"" means ""two hundred."""
3788	"Oh, Dad, you're finally home."
3789	"Well, alright. I'm a little rusty, but um, I'll try. Baruch ata, addonoy, elohanu melech ha-olom, ha-motzee le-chem mean ha-aretz."
3790	"-- ant. Oh, and as for that brutish fellow who knocked me out the window... see that he gets what's coming to him."
3791	How did you do all that?
3792	"Hey, Apu, what's with the line?"
3793	"Oh, I can't see the name of the station... but the gas costs one forty-nine and eight tenths."
3794	Boy I bet that looked cool in super slow-motion. Too bad we saw it in regular motion.
3795	"All right, you chop my hands half way off and then I'll still have enough strength to chop..."
3796	"All right, Lis, let's get this stupid bedtime story over with."
3797	"Oh honey, think pink. Look, a salute to safe sex!"
3798	...But our sames go right down to the bone. Maybe we do have a...
3799	"Hmmm, I hope my poor little baby's okay."
3800	But neighbor... why did you have to do this? I've tattled this town into a paradise!
3801	Proud Nubian Princess. Score!
3802	Why'd they leave England?
3803	"Okay, but could you pay me under the table? I got a little tax problem."
3804	"So here's the deal: you freeze everything as it is, and I won't ask for anything more. If that is okay, please give me absolutely no sign. Okay, deal. In gratitude, I present you this offering of cookies and milk. If you want me to eat them for you, give me no sign. Thy will be done."
3805	That young adult looks like Lisa. Whuh? That young adult is Lisa.
3806	A convict painted that?
3807	"I guess we can't afford pies right now. Well, throw something!"
3808	So how was your ride with Barney?
3809	"Come on, let's get you into your favorite shirt."
3810	IF I COULD WALK WITH THE ANIMALS / TALK WITH THE ANIMALS / GRUNT AND SQUEAK AND SQUAWK WITH THE ANIMALS...
3811	"Is anything the matter, my son? Talk to me, young man."
3812	"Hmm, perhaps. Tell you what. We come back and everyone's slaughtered, I owe you a coke."
3813	"Aw, don't give up, boy. I believe in you -- and not just because I have to."
3814	How many men do you know?
3815	"Wow! An actual robot from the movie ""Clank! Clank! You're Dead!"""
3816	All right! That's it. We're goin' home. I'm sick of you and your stupid tonic!
3817	"Hey, ""Vegas Mom,"" how long are you gonna stay here?"
3818	This dude ranch is gonna be great -- a whole week without hearing that stupid song.
3819	"Honey, this marriage is a partnership. When you fall, I pick you up. And when you can't finish a sandwich, I eat that sandwich."
3820	"Give me that! Bart, this is your father. Do you know where the remote is? I looked all over the house."
3821	"Krusty, why don't you talk to your Dad? He'll cheer you up. He's a Rabbi. He must've learned something from that giant star scroll he's always reading."
3822	You can't kick me out. It'll cause a miscount in the census. A miscount!
3823	"Hey! Oh, you meant that as a compliment. Now on this show, they want you to sing two songs. Maybe we should give them something new."
3824	"Now, let me show you around. Over there are the preppies."
3825	I love the use of streamers as blood. It robs the violence of its power.
3826	Hmmm... the sea won't stand for this.
3827	Why not? Are you having red meat?
3828	"Now, there's an employee, Smithers. A smile on his lips and a song in his heart. Promote him!"
3829	Take that Washington!
3830	"Now I've seen everything. Black marbleized with a liquid center. The ""Stealth Bowler"" -- the pins don't know what hit 'em."
3831	"Well, we're gonna make some changes around here. This store's gonna be run by kids and for kids."
3832	You have?! That's so nice!
3833	"Okay, I'll nudge 'em with the car. We'll get a whole ""meet cute"" thing going."
3834	This guy here... this is the guy.
3835	Wow! Of all the luck! To think I almost died without telling the boss to eat my shorts.
3836	"Look up at the stars, Springfield! For eons, people have gazed at the skies and seen into their souls."
3837	"Well, if I may dust off an old chestnut, aye carumba. Aye carumba indeed."
3838	Canada? Why should we leave America to visit America Junior?
3839	"Hey, who cut out Beetle Bailey? I need my Miss Buxley fix."
3840	Now I'm gonna learn a new word.
3841	And the national flag is a two-headed eagle on a red field.
3842	Okay! We're there! Finally!
3843	"Of all the... I will not be lampooned by school children. Kill them, Smithers."
3844	Who's up for a merry jig?
3845	That sounds like Sideshow Bob!
3846	"Boy, I never thought I'd have my own dark room."
3847	If you say it like Dracula I will.
3848	Maybe you should let Dad read your book before you submit it to publishers.
3849	"Oh, wait a minute. The family name is my legacy to you. I got it from my father, and he got it from his father. And he traded a mule for it. And that mule went on to save Spring Break..."
3850	And brace yourself: I put some thought into it.
3851	Dough-nuts?! I told you I don't like ethnic food!
3852	"Eww, gross! I bet you can't twist it."
3853	"So, that's our story. Oh wait, we were attacked by a giant whale. He turned out to be pretty cool."
3854	I don't care! My grandson's soul is at stake!
3855	"Or, check out this MyTunes-exclusive episode of ""Itchy and Scratchy."""
3856	What are you crying about? How cool they are?
3857	"Homer, are you scaring those kids?"
3858	You're making my tombstone!
3859	"Jeez, they're dropping like flies."
3860	Four thousand dollars?!
3861	"Congratulations, Artie."
3862	"So, what did you children learn about today?"
3863	"No, I have a better idea! We could build real men. Out of snow."
3864	"Peace talks break down. No. ""For sale, Ford Festiva..."" I'll put that in the ""maybes."" I gotta get that T-shirt."
3865	What do you need it for?
3866	"Now, now, now. Don't beat yourself up. I'm the one who drove her out of her seat. I'm the one who provoked the lethal barrage of t-shirts. I'm the one who parked in the ambulance zone preventing any possible resuscitation..."
3867	You know about I.M. Pei? I.M. impressed.
3868	What a great show: real people with real problems!
3869	"We can still order a replacement from the academy, right?"
3870	Thank you... you're very sweet...
3871	Do you ever drink to escape from reality?
3872	Buh... guh... muh... wuh. Zuh.
3873	I have such a big ass.
3874	"This is no act, they're actually trying to kill us!"
3875	Are you crazy? I can't believe a play where every character was murdered could be so boring.
3876	And may the best man win. He's got a big drinking problem - could embarrass the program. Meet me up in that tree later and I'll tell you more.
3877	"All right, we get it!"
3878	"Santa, one thing's still buggin' me. Why didn't you ever come back to pick me up?"
3879	I'm gonna eat EIGHT pieces of chocolate.
3880	"Hey Lis, some fifth graders are having a make-your-own pizza party at Flesh-In-The-Pan Pizza, and wanted me to invite you."
3881	"Oh, sorry, wrong for this audience. I thought Swapper Jack's was something else."
3882	"No. Well anyway, turn it off."
3883	It sure is peaceful up here.
3884	That sounds horrible.
3885	"Marge, Marge, Marge. Remember when those smooth-talking guys tried to sell me a time-share vacation condo?"
3886	How else could he have gotten this?
3887	"Hey man, if the line's this long, it's gotta be good."
3888	"Uh, yeah... i-it's really something."
3889	I think I'm gonna throw up the mac and cheese you fed me. I'm not supposed to have it. That's why I had so much.
3890	"Well, do you have a number where we can reach him?"
3891	"Well, I'll just call you friend. Here's your tape... friend."
3892	Now I know how Sir Dudley Winthrop felt when he first fell through the ceiling and discovered the Temple of Isis.
3893	"Tickets, thirty dollars! Big game, everyone wants to see the game..."
3894	"Oh, thank God. I thought I broke two off."
3895	"Sorry, I'm just not used to everyone behaving."
3896	"Honey, did you have any luck?"
3897	I'll catch up to you.
3898	"Shut your squeal hole, booze jockey. I'm gonna, like, totally waste you."
3899	That's not enough! We demand more asbestos! More Asbestos!
3900	"Hey, you know, I don't think this guy likes girls."
3901	"Or what? You'll release the dogs? Or the bees? Or the dogs with bees in their mouths, and when they bark, they shoot bees at you? Well go ahead, do your worst."
3902	"Well, he's got me there."
3903	You're pirating my movie?
3904	The door? Now I'll never get to pee.
3905	"Ah, forget it. Let's go."
3906	Still lookin' for a new faith?
3907	"Yeah, but what about Bart?"
3908	"Woo hoo! First stop, Maude Flanders."
3909	"Wait a minute. You're telling me the police force, the TV news, a courthouse full of people, and a popular entertainer had nothing better to do than to teach me and Bart a lesson?"
3910	No thanks. I'm wearing my cure for depression.
3911	"Homer, that's not a good thing."
3912	"Herb, I appreciate your generosity, but I don't need any gift from you."
3913	"Bart, we're gonna lose. We have to do something."
3914	"You brought a convict to live here, near my unpatented idea?"
3915	"Man, this place has got everything!"
3916	Tomatoes? What kind of artists are you?
3917	"Okay, keep an eye peeled for Zelda."
3918	"I've gotta set things straight. During that same race, my friend Milhouse was in the lead, when something horrible happened..."
3919	We tried to break up your parents and we broke up mine!
3920	But we're the more powerful country for a few more years.
3921	"No, I'll have you know, I've decided to give my money away to truly needy causes. But a hundred thousand dollars just isn't enough. I need more."
3922	"Or, or, um, with, with a funny hat on."
3923	"Lord, please use your space-age, clog-busting powers on this stubborn drain. Then take some time off for yourself. Fly to France. Have a nice dinner."
3924	Former President Gerald Ford? Put 'er there! I'm Homer Simpson.
3925	"I may not know much about you, but you sure know a lot of wonderful things about me. And that means a lot to a woman."
3926	"What a nice idea, son. It's uh, upstairs on the second floor of our house. I'll just go get it."
3927	That is the most dishonest thing I've ever heard.
3928	I brought him back here so he could take Nelson away and my bruises would heal.
3929	Why are you singing that?
3930	"Those last three avalanches were your fault, Simpson."
3931	"I'm telling! Oh, man."
3932	"All right, step away from the old masters and kick 'em over here. Come on."
3933	Wanna play some air hockey?
3934	"You have the most wonderful Mom in the world, which is why I have no idea where she is or what she's doing."
3935	"Bart, you're supposed to be at Camp David."
3936	That takes care of those three -- want to go for a lakeside snuggle?
3937	"Oh, I love this song."
3938	"Huh? Oh, myself, I guess."
3939	"OOOH, WHAT A LUCKY MAN..."
3940	"Fine, there's a Daddy Claus."
3941	"Son, the healthy thing is to get rid of everything that reminds you of Krusty...which appears to be everything. Hey, maybe we should give Lisa this room. You know she works for Krusty now."
3942	Our instruments are rusting!
3943	Would you like to come in for tea and marshmallow squares?
3944	"Inspiration Point looks pretty uninspired... All's quiet in Murder Town... Yep, Springfield is cleaner than the Lord's hand towels."
3945	Homie! Stop watching the movie in the other people's car!
3946	"Oh Marge, every woman I iÂ­nÂ­tÂ­eÂ­rview for the secretary job makes kissy faces at me."
3947	"No. And, since I'm sure that you'd only resent the pity of an eight-year-old niece, I'll simply hope that you're one of the statistically insignificant forty-year-old single women who ever find their fair Prince."
3948	What's wrong with Principal Skinner?
3949	"Well, I bet it's nothing a little turpentine won't take off. Come on, son."
3950	"Really? Well, why didn't you say so? Let's roll!"
3951	Overtime for bag boys? Ridiculous!
3952	"Oh kids, I heart you, too!"
3953	I've had it with that school!
3954	"It's the principle, Smithers! Nobody steals from Montgomery Burns, whether it be my Sunday newspaper or my loutish oaf of a son."
3955	"Relax, a photo can't make any difference."
3956	"Does it have its own satellite dish, sir?"
3957	"Hey, guys. Guess who just became lactose-tolerant?"
3958	I didn't tell you to quit your job.
3959	COMING OUT OF MY EIGHT-TRACK...
3960	We have one at home. You never use it.
3961	But Marge! It looks so easy! Just like carving a turkey.
3962	Are you gonna shoot me in the back of the head?
3963	"Hey, the comic book store's still open!"
3964	"Son, we wanna help you catch that plug-ugly-yegg."
3965	"Because if I do it enough, maybe they'll start to pay me."
3966	It's like they saw our lives and put it right up on screen.
3967	Mr. Burns seemed like such a nice man the day he arrived.
3968	"Hi mom. Hi dad. Home already? Boy, time really flies when you're reading... The Bible? Ew."
3969	"I don't see how you can support Proposition 24, Dad."
3970	"No! Look, take the art if you want. Just don't hurt the boy."
3971	"Oh man, is this awkward. I'm outta here."
3972	No waaaay. Gg-aah... Yes'm.
3973	How can they put a prop from a TV show next to the Bill of Rights?
3974	"Prayer, the last refuge of a scoundrel."
3975	"Don't you touch bead one! Homer, maybe we should be concerned. Catholics can be a peculiar bunch -- no birth control, no meat on Friday..."
3976	Good for you. No more drinkin'?
3977	I was just trying to make this a healthier place to live.
3978	Five ninety-nine?! What a rip-off! Someone should shoot you!
3979	"Homer, no! Those were made in the Sixties."
3980	My love. You saved my life.
3981	You have a newspaper too?
3982	"What about ""Colossal Salary Grab""?"
3983	"Kolchak, Mannix, Banacek, Danno!"
3984	So how come we have all these other keys?
3985	"Dear Lisa, May your new saxophone bring you years of D'oh!"
3986	"Whoa! Ouch! Ow! Ooh! Oh no, boys, not the can, please."
3987	How is that fun? Fun is only fun if everyone's having fun.
3988	"This is just a kickball with ""Mars"" written on it."
3989	"How about a little neck rub, baby?"
3990	Now let's go save those kids.
3991	"There's only one place in town where the bees can survive. And Mr. Burns wants to tear it down. Please, people. You didn't listen to me about the snail darter, you didn't listen to me about the osprey, and you didn't listen to me about the javelina."
3992	That was a miracle and it was gross. Cool.
3993	That caterpillar is screaming.
3994	Confident... Vassar sticker on the windshield... could it be... do I detect... enthusiasm?!
3995	So that's how it happened!
3996	"For more information, visit our website, www.al-jazeera.com. We're not affiliated. We're just piggybacking on their message board."
3997	You remembered my name!
3998	Everyone in that live studio audience is dead now.
3999	I've never gotten a B before.
4000	Hmmm. So... is it okay if I go to the women's conference with Chloe?
4001	Ned Flanders in Tinseltown?
4002	Aww. Innocent babies whistling nonchalantly. How sweet. Maggie will be back to play with you tomorrow.
4003	"Don't worry, I won't embarrass you."
4004	"How are my boys doin', Homer?"
4005	"Dear God, we paid for all this stuff ourselves, so thanks for nothin'."
4006	SPRINGFIELD -- WHY NOT?!
4007	Damned infernal gizmo. My kingdom for a left-handed can opener!
4008	You really came back from that Tommy John surgery.
4009	"That's just you, Bart."
4010	We're not paramedics!
4011	"Okay, I've set my trap. Now to scatter my cheese cubes and the rats will come. Condos! Affordable condos! Bail-jumpers welcome!"
4012	"Spin the top. If it falls over, we're in reality. If it spins forever, we're still in a dream."
4013	AND DANCE BY THE LIGHT OF THE MOONNNNNNNN!
4014	Did you just drug me?
4015	Pathetic. A kid who can't keep his parents' marriage together is no kid at all.
4016	But I saw you praying to Mecca!
4017	There's gotta be something I haven't tried. Huh? Hey! What's this? Fugu!
4018	"Yeah, Skinner said you wouldn't have the wontons to go through with it."
4019	Why do you need new bands? Everyone knows rock attained perfection in 1974. It's a scientific fact.
4020	"Well, I bet I smell better."
4021	"Whatever. Take 'em away, boys."
4022	I'm gonna die in my jammies!
4023	"I've got to get back in that room, but Skinner took away the only key! What would Nancy Drew do?"
4024	"Oh, I don't know about this dog. He's kinda... snooty."
4025	Forget the clubs. Just shoot him.
4026	"Say, Todd, I want to talk to your Uncle Homer. You're head of the car till I get back."
4027	"Don't feel bad, Homie. I married you! And you're a million times better than-- here comes Vance!!!"
4028	"Oh, yes. And punish Lisa for lying to us."
4029	"Oh, son, no. We've got a lotta catchin' up to do. What do you say... we go fishin'?"
4030	"Hmm, I know what the other eleven forks are for, but what do you do with this one?"
4031	Now where's she going?
4032	"I wish he were, Rod, I pray for the day, but I'm afraid he's just delirious from fever."
4033	"Yeah, let's blow this pop stand and never look back."
4034	"Now that we're married, I wanna tell you I have one strict policy: no wife of mine ever has to work."
4035	"No, no, you're lying! You're lying! What makes you lie?"
4036	Go! Go! Go! Now's your chance!
4037	Dad?! You always hated church!
4038	Who wants pork chops?
4039	"You're dead, J.J. Get yourself buried!"
4040	"Hey, how do you get this thing to play Blackjack?"
4041	Mom! Dad! I got the lead!
4042	"And I always got the spillover. Drive-in movies, two Christmases, soda with dinner -- we lived like kings!"
4043	"Very dramatic, sir. A little more brooding, and..."
4044	Three dollars? That doesn't seem so bad.
4045	And sometimes I got into trouble...
4046	"Why don't you read ""Cathy""? She's hilarious."
4047	"Woop, sorry son. I didn't know you, Jay Leno, and a monkey were bathing a clown."
4048	"Oh, don't worry, you'll pick it up fast. Once you get to foursies, you're in the zone."
4049	Maybe I'll go slip into something a little more comfortable.
4050	"Dad, this is a hundred and ten dollars."
4051	WE CAN'T EVEN GET ANY LOCAL LAWS PASSED / WITHOUT EVERYONE SINGING LIKE A BIG BROADWAY CAST.
4052	"Hmm, tie it to my car and you've got a deal."
4053	"Ohhh, slow down, Frenchy! This stuff is gold."
4054	Lisa? My one true love.
4055	My husband and I have been snuggling six ways from Sunday...
4056	"So long, lamp. Now stop loafing, and help your Grampa unpack."
4057	You should have seen the look on your face. It was something like this.
4058	"Mom, Dad, someone stole my Malibu Stacy collection!"
4059	I want you to get rid of these springs.
4060	I'm happy for the school. It sounds like this money is gonna provide a lot of new opportunities.
4061	I don't have any diamonds.
4062	"Okay, here's the solution -- I want you kids to lock the bedroom from the outside, so I can't get out and perpetrate my nocturnal mischief."
4063	I told you! I find them boring.
4064	Your daughter barely knows who you are!
4065	She hit the bottle pretty hard and lost her job.
4066	"No objections, eh? Oh, that's great."
4067	"Yes, but I have one more thing to show you."
4068	Darn thing's stuck. I'll give it a good yank...
4069	I think you're underreacting.
4070	"Ohh, pretty creepy. Still, I'd rather have him chasing me than of the Wolf Man."
4071	"Because I'm ""jinxed"" dammit!"
4072	I can't remember when I felt this young. I really can't.
4073	"Oh, isn't that sweet? He named it after his wife."
4074	Venus Simpson? You're replacing me?
4075	Why should I feel like a traffic cop every Sunday morning when I'm just trying to get a little goodness into the family.
4076	"And here I was waiting till you slept to rob you of your copper. You know, it's crazy, but..."
4077	"...but I have something more important to say. For reasons beyond my control, I will soon become vapid, sluggish, and slow-witted. So before that happens, I want to share some things with you that have really meant a lot to me..."
4078	That doesn't sound like they like you at all.
4079	Nelson? He couldn't have made a movie by himself. Who helped him?
4080	"Oh no! I don't have to listen to you. If I'm not on camera, you can't see me!"
4081	It is. I know it's hard to see a young buck like me and think of a day when I'm no longer in the pink.
4082	"Your whole life, you never said one nice thing to me."
4083	"No, no, they're wrong! The creature they seek is the walking undead. Nosferatu! Das Wampyre!"
4084	"Quick, it's Moe. I gotta hide the mugs..."
4085	First prize... first prize...
4086	Hm. I've never seen anyone eat pizza like that.
4087	Heh... heh... heh. Bullwinkle's antler sprung a leak.
4088	"Your Honor, I'd like to be tried separately."
4089	"There's that side of it. But there's also... help me out here, Lisa."
4090	"Go ride bikes for a while, huh."
4091	How could somebody...?
4092	"I dunno, Herb. People are afraid of new things. You should have taken an existing product and put a clock in it or something."
4093	"Pardon me, sir. Forgive my clumsiness."
4094	"Ooo, ""Regularsville."" Sounds like my kind of place!"
4095	"Hey, everybody, look who's back! It's the biiig baby! Oh, this porridge is too hot! Oh, waah waah waah!"
4096	"Hear that, Bart? You're going to have a little brother or sister to play with!"
4097	"Oh, we're never gonna get out of... Psst, cleaning lady. Would you let us out of here?"
4098	Can that judge do this to us?
4099	"Don't be selfish, Lisa."
4100	"Move it or lose it, toots!"
4101	"Who should appear but the unrequited love of my college years, Mimsy Bancroft...Of course, by then Mimsy had her share of wrinkles and a gray hair or two, but my adoring eyes saw past those minor imperfections to her 21-year-old daughter, Lily."
4102	"What is it, boy? What? Mmmmmmmm... bar-b-que."
4103	A splendid gentlemen's club. You've earned my respect.
4104	Are you my conscience?
4105	"Here, take this. My daughter didn't want the lunch I made."
4106	Remember that crappy ice cream truck I bought?
4107	"Besides my kids, the only thing in my life is my business... The Leftorium. We've been the anchor store in the ""sad mall"" for the last ten years."
4108	"Gas your termites... ""Freeze your termites""... ""Zap your termites""... ""Save the termites""... Hel-lo."
4109	Bart did it! That Bart right there!
4110	"Uh, gee, I'd really love to want to help you, Flanders, but uh, Marge was taken prisoner in the... Holy Land and uh..."
4111	More like pre-school.
4112	Don't make me learn about it.
4113	"It's a new record, sir."
4114	Hey Homie. Did you try the punch?
4115	"Bart, this isn't a photograph. I'm not just gonna paint you into--"
4116	Seymour... Edna asked me to talk to you.
4117	"Aw, I think you're cute, too."
4118	"Hm, let me make a note of that."
4119	Apologize! For what?! Clearing the table? Having a sense of humor? They think they can starve an apology out of me. Ha!
4120	"So you see, revenge is great. And there's three ways to talk about it. Although two of the ways were kind of the same way, and even the third one might have worked better as a Halloween story..."
4121	You didn't vote for anybody.
4122	But we lost the Olympics to Shelbyville.
4123	"Dad, they're offering us an all-expenses paid trip to the greatest sporting event on earth!"
4124	"So, anyway, this is the story of Maggie Roarke, an architect who refused to compromise."
4125	"There's got to be a way to get that tree back. Hey, look. A hospital! Pull in there."
4126	"Well, that is one lucky creepy guy."
4127	That's why I ran away from home.
4128	But aren't you gonna have fun finding out?
4129	Those perfectionists? Forget it.
4130	She sure is. This morning I got to second base... on our walk around the softball diamond.
4131	I'm not blowing up the plant. Just harmlessly stopping it from doing more damage to Mother Earth.
4132	"Well I've got a Valentine's Day story! It's about musicians from a simpler time. The era of The Brady Bunch, Donny and Marie, and..."
4133	Are you sure you want to give me a car?
4134	"There he is, off in the distance!"
4135	I played this just perfectly.
4136	I don't care if it is illegal. I'm makin' a stand here. Who's with me?
4137	I have three kids and no money! Why can't I have no kids and three money?
4138	THE NANNY WE WANT IS KINDLY AND SAGE.
4139	"Sure you did -- ""Mr. Plow."" You're wearin' the jacket right now!"
4140	"Okay Milhouse, the guys in back are putting your new bike together."
4141	"Apu, you're a bachelor. Get up there!"
4142	"I don't know her name, but she held up a liquor store last year."
4143	To my new buddy. Now all we need is an awesome theme song. Whatever plays next on the jukebox.
4144	Wow. Now I see why they call you Miss Hoover.
4145	But I need to talk about man stuff!
4146	Hmm. That's odd. It didn't come out the rear end.
4147	That can be arranged.
4148	"Wow! Breathe it in, boys!"
4149	"Gee, I always like to help you, Homer, but I don't want to be an accessory to some sort of shady doin's. And it does raise a whole host of ethical questions, such as..."
4150	"Well sir, I'm opening a one-stop store for Southpaws. Everything from left-handed apple peelers to left-handed zithers. I'm gonna call it the Leftorium."
4151	"My old man. Well, I gotta go."
4152	"Remove the chocks, Simpson. Simpson?"
4153	"Wha? My doctor said ""don't walk."""
4154	"Gold! Wait, this is just chocolate. Chocolate!"
4155	The interrogation chair.
4156	"Oh, look at their guts."
4157	Does that include tip?
4158	All right. Everyone inside. Let's go.
4159	He's wrong! You're wrong! The whole damn system is wrong!
4160	Why didn't you say that before!
4161	C'mon! We've been here for fifteen minutes. Can't you see they're sucking the life out of us?
4162	Homie! I thought you were at that sports bar.
4163	"Elegy for Geezer Rock: / ""Postcard image, thing to see, / To think of Springfield is to think of thee. / What thoughts be-pass a'hind thy mien? / Why sky art blue, why trees art green? And what, pray tell, did thine eyes see? / Perchance, old friend, they gazed at me. / Brought low by nature's oafish hand, / Thou crush-ed our reviewing stand / And twixt thy stones glimpsed I the truth: / All things must pass -- thy face, my youth."""
4164	This campus is so lush and verdant.
4165	You're joking. You've gotta be joking.
4166	"That's short for ""Rrright you are!"""
4167	"Ouch, this place is fancy."
4168	How'd you get in here?
4169	I'm doing a walk-on. It's a show business thing. So how y'all doin'? Let's see... What's in the news today?
4170	"Me again! So if Dad loved his jokes, then..."
4171	"Watch your language, moron."
4172	Then why are you hiding?
4173	"Hear ye, HEAR YE, HEAR YE!!"
4174	"This better work, boy. I don't wanna wind up workin' on your mother's emu farm."
4175	"She wants to steal a kiss, like Pyramus and Thisbe."
4176	"Now, when you've got a bum ticker like we do, you need all the friends you can get. And Moe's is the friendliest place in the Rum District."
4177	"Goodbye, Homer! I try to save our marriage, and you just get drunk and spend the whole night with your homosexual boyfriends!"
4178	"Homie, stop! You're not a God!"
4179	"Ohh, I gotta get rid of these guys."
4180	"Oh, honey, I'm so proud of you. All your hard work and grade grubbing have finally paid off!"
4181	I'd better be heading home... to my family... enjoy your evening... with your wonderful... uh... neon sign...
4182	"Oh no, Bart has stolen the elderly!"
4183	"Well, what about Bart?"
4184	"All right, I admit it! I am the Lindbergh baby. Whaa whaa. Goo goo. I miss my fly-fly da-da."
4185	I'd like to get into some blue pants right now.
4186	I don't think we're doing this right.
4187	"It's a breakthrough product, sir: scientifically formulated to rinse clean with no oily deposits."
4188	"Yeah, 'cause you're smart. You don't say ""kill,"" you say ""prank."" Like Mom and Dad say ""snuggle"" when what they really mean is ""let's lock the door and hug."""
4189	I'm afraid I have a bone to pick with you.
4190	I don't have a friend in the world.
4191	"Oh, I get it. These are those trick candles you can't blow out."
4192	Attention teenage boys. Take your hands off my daughter!
4193	"If I could be any type of shark, I'd be a tiger shark. How 'bout you, Milhouse?"
4194	They took the bait. Let's go.
4195	"Oh, that can't be good."
4196	I'M GETTING BLUE PANTS IN THE MORNING / DING DONG THE ZIPPER'S GONNA SHINE...
4197	"Think about it. I mean, what ""team"" was Babe Ruth on? Who knows?"
4198	You don't have to do this.
4199	"Nobody owns Christmas Carols. They belong to everyone, like grapes at the grocery store!"
4200	It was a beautiful wedding. I've never seen Selma happier.
4201	"Sh, sh. Shhhhh. Soon you'll know peace."
4202	To this school? On purpose? Even after Springfield Montessori opened across the street?
4203	"I miss you too, honey."
4204	I know. I'm taping it. I want to get to Mr. Burns' house bright and early to make his breakfast.
4205	"Oh God, my gums! They hurt so much!"
4206	"Oh my God, I forgot all about this. Where did you find it?"
4207	"You know, I'm no art critic, but I know what I hate. And I don't hate this. Your painting is bold but beautiful. And uh, incidentally, thanks for not making fun of my genitalia."
4208	Simpson -- Monty Burns. Come with me.
4209	"Well, sir, for one thing we had a problem every Tuesday, when the cafeteria would serve fish sticks."
4210	"Wow, she really likes you. Maybe the next time I need a sitter, and you're not busy..."
4211	Surely some holds are barred.
4212	But I was really looking forward to...
4213	Someone will. I'm gonna crack the bully code.
4214	Little do you know that the Count of Monte Cristo is in fact an old acquaintance of yours.
4215	"... And that's why today, bananas are called ""yellow fatty beans."" Questions?"
4216	Let's take a ride. I got a place with a view.
4217	Homie... I think the baby's coming.
4218	That baby-proofing crook wanted to sell us safety covers for the electrical outlets.
4219	No problem. We can still have fun without you drinking.
4220	"Oh no! Two-hundred and thirty-nine pounds. I'm a whale. Why was I was cursed with this weakness for snack treats? Well, from now on, exercise every morning, Homer."
4221	That shot is impossible! Jack Nicholson himself couldn't make it.
4222	"Yes, I'd like to pledge ten thousand dollars to get them to shut up. From... anonymous."
4223	Wait a minute. Everybody thinks we're at camp this week. We can stay wherever we want.
4224	"I know this looks bad, but if you reverse it, Daddy's a hero!"
4225	"Eh, well, I wouldn't be happy."
4226	"We'll be fine, honey. The main thing is for you to get better."
4227	"Hey, gimme one of those famous giant beers I've heard so much about."
4228	"Well, sometimes that can be annoying."
4229	Why does Lenny need a windmill anyway?
4230	Did you flash your lights?
4231	"Look, Maggie! They have a story lady!"
4232	"No. They went for a walk with the Flanders. Bart, what's going on? Why are these repo guys taking all your stuff?"
4233	Shut it off. They're losers.
4234	"You know, Homie, a lot of men use their Saturdays to do things around the house, hint, hint."
4235	All right! Girls night out! Exotic male dancers at the Golden Banana!
4236	So that's it. You just wanted me to help you gamble. You never wanted to be with me at all.
4237	Our first night together as man and wife.
4238	"Hurry up kids, you'll miss the bus!"
4239	"Cheesesteak, a little advice from a mother of three: they'll turn out the same whether you gallop or trot."
4240	"So Homer, I'm dyin' to know. What do you think of the Leftorium?"
4241	How'd you like it if I made fun of your pants?
4242	"Befoul an army helmet? You'd like that, wouldn't ya, hippie?"
4243	That's not the way she tells it.
4244	"I was wondering, Sir, do we really need to, uh... ""settle"" Abe Simpson? I mean, I'm familiar with his physical state, and perhaps if we wait, nature will assassinate him for us."
4245	"Yo! Lis! Lis! Come back, Lis! Come back!"
4246	"Ew. Okay, let's get started."
4247	It saved our marriage!
4248	"No, no one's ""going Catholic."" Three children is enough, thank you."
4249	"Thanks for the freedom of speech, dorks."
4250	Wait a minute! There's probably a --
4251	"Hey, don't listen to me! What do I know about rainbows?!"
4252	"Nelson, how'd you like to earn some extra money around our house? I have some odd jobs my kids won't do."
4253	"I know you're upset right now, so I'll pretend you didn't say that."
4254	"Well, any hoodily-doodle, the embassy says it's just a routine hostage-taking -- but I have to drive to Capital City, fill out some forms to get 'em out. Could you possibly watch the kids tonight?"
4255	"Run, Marge! Start the car!"
4256	This is the lowest we've sunk.
4257	"Well, I hate this job, but I love the health plan."
4258	"What am I doing? Untent! Untent! Oh Bart, I want to win, but not like this. I'm sorry. You're fired!"
4259	So that's where my soot went!
4260	"All right, all right, you guys can have Serena."
4261	"Yeah, but I don't feel any better."
4262	"Quick, Moe! Marge cut off my thumb."
4263	Ah! Uh... I'm just resting my eyes. Holy moly! Nine-thirty.
4264	I got the week off by telling Mr. Burns I had a neck injury!
4265	"Marge, I split my pants again. Oooh, can I have two sandwiches today? Make them bologna sandwiches too. Can I have two slices of bologna and cheese..."
4266	"Well, I guess you learned your lesson, so now I'll untie ya."
4267	"Well, I'm worried that you're making too big a deal of this silly little kiddie golf tournament."
4268	"No, Dad. You could really brighten the holidays for those less fortunate."
4269	"Up-bup-bup-bup! That's an Apu question. You're ""Greg."""
4270	"Same time, same place?"
4271	"Oh, I'm an old fool. I don't even have two kidneys to rub together."
4272	"Hey Homer, I've been singing your praises all day. Marge said we could have choir practice in your house tonight."
4273	"I've gotta get back, too! I just remembered I was playing hide and seek with Milhouse."
4274	Why did you let him be his own barrister?
4275	"Thank you, Lord! It's back the way it was."
4276	I'm not really in the mood anymore.
4277	"Yeah, I hear it too. Maybe we can cover it up by singing a fun song. ""WE WILL, WE WILL ROCK YOU..."""
4278	"Put a sock in it, Roy."
4279	I told you we should have parked next to the curb.
4280	"Oh, way to go, Lou. You hit him!"
4281	"Well, get yourself another hero, kid. I'm all washed up."
4282	I'm here protecting our investment. I'd like you to go home and make dinner for the kids.
4283	How can something that applies to Bart apply to me? I'm so much older and wiser.
4284	"Wow, the Tooth Chipper!"
4285	"I was thinking mantle, too! Talk about being on the same wavelength."
4286	"Lis, what do you call those guys in chess that don't matter?"
4287	No! Stop the hovering!
4288	"Honey... on a non-stone fruit-related topic, I booked us a couples massage."
4289	Quit it! Must wash eyes! J--
4290	Are you sure you don't want me to do it? 'Cause I can do it. I got the outfit right here.
4291	"No! No! It wasn't me! I would never do anything like that. It was just one of those immature people who, instead of building themselves up --"
4292	"All right, and if Todd wins, you have to mow my lawn! And do a decent job of it, for a change!"
4293	"Uh-oh, looks like rain. We better get this baby home."
4294	"All right, I got another one!"
4295	Making fun of someone's clothes. How original.
4296	Uh-huh. See you at five then.
4297	"Don't open it, Homie! It's a virus!"
4298	We were sitting in Barney's car eating packets of mustard. Ya happy?
4299	"No, sir! Whom should I kill?"
4300	"Ah... I'm still gonna put you away, you know."
4301	"Okay, if you're that worried about it, let's go down to the bomb shelter."
4302	"Sorry Sideshow Bob, but it's her special birthday wish."
4303	Here she comes! And-a one and-a two and-a...
4304	"Well, if my country needs me... Can we skinny-dip?"
4305	"I'm squeezing... I'm squee-zing it. Hey, I squeezed so hard it went into my hand."
4306	"Homer, my friend, of all the false messiahs today, I think you came closest to the truth."
4307	"Well, there's nothing scarier than having to go to school. Ugh."
4308	"Hey Homer, how come you're not hugging the dog?"
4309	"Oh, yeah. I didn't think this was for me."
4310	"That's great, it rhymes with ""moo""!"
4311	And you'll lose weight?
4312	"Well, I'd better skedaddle. Oh, there's one more weensy little thing -- you see that tree over there?"
4313	"No, Dad, it's a rhetorical question."
4314	"Homie, they're beautiful. That Chevron station has the most romantic bouquets! I feel a swoon coming on... Here it is!"
4315	"Curse that Elon Musk! Thanks to that Earth-smooching buttinski, I'm on the verge of bankruptcy. All I have left are the clothes on my back and the clones in my freezer."
4316	"Homer, there's a man here who thinks he can help you."
4317	"Come here, you little--"
4318	"Homer, could you come with me for a minute?"
4319	"Told ya. Now, come on. You're gonna learn how to shave."
4320	"I'm sorry for fibbing. Tell you what -- if you don't like it, you can complain all the way home."
4321	Go Mom! You can do it!
4322	"Okay, just everybody remain calm."
4323	"Look, they have Lincoln's hat!"
4324	It's called a Lawnmower. I invented it. You want one?
4325	"You saw ""Ben-Hur"" without me?"
4326	Bobo? I meant Lobo. Sheriff Lobo. They never should have canceled that show.
4327	That Chief Wiggum. What a dope.
4328	"Wow, look at all these gadgets! If I were a nerd, I'd be in heaven."
4329	What an age we live in!
4330	I mean andante! Andante!
4331	"Caitlin, hi! Do a reading at your bat mitzvah? A sheynam dank!"
4332	"Homer, look, we're invited to Otto's wedding!"
4333	"Ned Flanswered, that is."
4334	"Bless you, son. I knew you'd come through for me."
4335	"Okay, next item of business is our weekly progress report. Principal Skinner? How's your transportation project coming?"
4336	"No, we have to commit ourselves. Now take this down. ""Free to loving home. World's most brilliant dog. Says 'I love you' on command."""
4337	You monsters! You've killed her!
4338	"All right! ""America's Most Armed and Dangerous."""
4339	There's exactly one Rita Lafleur living in Springfield!
4340	Don't worry. It's bottom all right.
4341	"Now the thing is, I don't have a lot of money..."
4342	"You just dodged a bullet, Mister Sugarpants."
4343	"Lisa, I gotta tell somebody. I was at the Quimby compound yesterday when that frog waiter got whacked. I know that Freddy Quimby is innocent."
4344	When I finally got back to the house...
4345	"All right, quit stallin', Burns. Who'd you ice?"
4346	"Look, honey, I know these glasses are a radical new technology and should be worn in moderation. Isn't that right, glasses?"
4347	Is it a place I'd look overdressed if I did wear a tie?
4348	"Oh, Homie, of course I will."
4349	I read at a 78th grade level.
4350	"Go ahead, leave. You'll come crawling back."
4351	"Yeah, I'm going right to the top."
4352	I've been waiting for you -- and trying to figure out how girls pee.
4353	"Well, that settles that. There is no silver tongue. Is there, Bonesy?"
4354	Where the H-E-C-K is everybody?
4355	"That means you went to college, right?"
4356	"There's an opening, Mom!"
4357	Boy cheeks!... Fanny!... Derriere!... Hiney!... Backside!... ...Cover up that coin slot!
4358	More alive than any of you squares!
4359	"Yes indeedy. Makin' some good scratch, too."
4360	Maybe he's giving those little baby birds some food.
4361	What's the point? They'll never notice.
4362	"I'm married to the sea, ""I don't want to kill you, but I will--"
4363	That's just a souvenir from an amusement park.
4364	"Yeah, you shake it up and it tells the future."
4365	"Well... that would... uh, wait... uh... do I read from the sheet labeled ""Jokes"" or ""Answers?"""
4366	"Whatever it does, it's doing it now."
4367	"Hey, Flash! Will ya sign my ball?"
4368	"Finally, we're gettin' somewhere."
4369	"This one's a good choice, and it's not too smutty. It's a book on tape by Paul Harvey, you know, that nice Midwestern man on the radio who's like a pleasant version of Grampa."
4370	"Boy, I can't wait to take some of the starch out of that stuffed shirt."
4371	"Well wishing won't make it so. You've got to pull up your diaper, get out there, and be the best damn Barney you can be."
4372	"How do you like my new wheels, Simpson?"
4373	"If that costume shop knew we were using these burglar outfits for real, they'd be furious."
4374	"Hey there, neighbor. You look as puffed up as a peacock in a..."
4375	Every man for himself! Trample if you must!
4376	Are you here to teach me or to kill me?
4377	"Oh, go eat some flowers."
4378	"Hey Marge, look what I brought home."
4379	I have nothing to say to you.
4380	All right. And what's the name?
4381	"Well, now that I'm forcibly retired, I feel I should give back to society and do some charitable work. But first, I want to take a lot of opium."
4382	Now we could smash the real Westminster Abbey so it looks like this.
4383	"Marge? Some casino guys have me, and they want the money you took from them, or else."
4384	"Lisa, it says one year and up."
4385	Easy... careful... steady...
4386	"ADULTS! / YOU'RE SUCH A DROOLING SNORING, BOOZING BORING BUNCH / SURLY, MEANIE, THREE-MARTINI LUNCH-ERS."
4387	"Ahoy there, Dean! I understand you're taking suggestions from students, eh? Well, me and my Fourth Form chums think it would be quite ""corking"" if you'd sign over your oil well to the local energy concern!"
4388	Oh dear. It would be a shame if that pretty dress got wet.
4389	"They have Simpson D.N.A. It could've come from any of us. Except you, since you're a Bouvier."
4390	"That's great, Mr. Zuckerberg, but I was hoping you could tell us how education was instrumental to your success."
4391	"Marge, I could stand here and argue with you, but then I'd have to get a new glass of milk. Goodnight, honey."
4392	"Hey, here's another letter for Bart's People."
4393	Still wanna be at Moe's?
4394	I decide who reads and when. How 'bout now?
4395	"In a situation like this, you just relax and let the current take you back to land."
4396	Putting speed holes in my car. Makes it go faster.
4397	Have any of your workers ever had their hands cut off by the machinery?
4398	"You just wanna see your old man trip and fall! Well, sorry to disappoint you, lad, but, what the--"
4399	"Not you, you imbecile."
4400	"It doesn't seem possible, but I guess TV has betrayed me."
4401	Throw the bee and go to college. Throw the bee and go to college...
4402	No. Because you're wearing a bib.
4403	Silence! You call yourself a Chinaman?
4404	Oh my God. Everyone's gone! Little Bart...
4405	"Homie, I'm a little worried. Do you know there were no customers between two and four?"
4406	"When the errant bill struck my chest, it left a distinctive bruise. Had my heart been inside at the time, it could have been fatal."
4407	"Don't worry about those losers, Marge. I think it's time we went home and collaborated on a little project of our own."
4408	"Oh, yeah? We'll just see about that."
4409	He called you a bad father.
4410	No! It's evil! Please stop recycling!
4411	"Oh, that load of crap? No, I was just keepin' her busy while Nelson stole microscopes. Make with the story."
4412	"Dad, leave -- so I can get into character."
4413	"Whoa, what the hell..."
4414	That's insane! My dad was married to a woman... who left him... because he ignored her needs for decades. My gay dad is gay for gays.
4415	"Homie, maybe this is too much electricity."
4416	"Mallomars. Oh, that's going in the act."
4417	MUST YOU BE FOREVER DIALING THAT PHONE?!!!
4418	I thought you left home to be a star.
4419	He worked two jobs to get me a pony... he started me playing the saxophone you all love...
4420	Don't let go of me Bart!
4421	Then throw them over the wall of the prison to create chaos and confusion.
4422	"Eh, I winna da race! Viva Italia!"
4423	That seems more like a detached tale of modern alienation.
4424	Oats are what a champion thoroughbred eats before he or she wins the Kentucky Derby.
4425	"Well, I have to work, but give the monitor a kiss."
4426	"Whatever you say, sir."
4427	"Homer, I've coughed up scarier stuff than that."
4428	"Actually, Marge... uh... there uh, was someone before you."
4429	"Don't worry, Marge. Take a look at this."
4430	"Oh, Dad, this is the best birthday I've ever had."
4431	Oooh. That would be a shame.
4432	I don't think that's gonna do it.
4433	Look at Moe dance! ALOHA MOE...
4434	"Well, if you don't know the right path to take, you have to be very quiet and listen for that little voice inside that tells you what to do."
4435	"Well, maybe they should have three. I'm Bart Simpson."
4436	"Uh, yeah, um, uh as a change of pace, I'm gonna let you do most of the work. I think you're ready for it, Alan."
4437	"Ooh, that was a close one, kids."
4438	"Homer, why don't you just call the pharmacy and --"
4439	"Okay, Lisa, we're ready for your centerpiece!"
4440	"Well, it's... Ah, you wouldn't be interested. It's too low brow."
4441	How dare you challenge my perceptions of what old people can do?
4442	"Dad, I wouldn't go outside if I were you."
4443	"Go ahead and join them, Smithers. I know you want to."
4444	"No, he's a bit listless, isn't he? Give me... Ooh, that spirited fellow..."
4445	"Oh, man. Plain cake donuts? Thanks for taking all the fancies, guys. Why can't I ever get here on time?"
4446	Pleehhh! Hnnnn! Plem! Feh!
4447	You mean there are losers who spend all day watching TV looking for stuff to complain about? Who'd be lame enough to do that?
4448	"I knew that Bongo would have a good home there, and Burns would never find him."
4449	"Things started out great. I ate what my mother ate. And my mother loved chili. Then, suddenly:"
4450	Ah! Ooh! Arg! Son of a -- ! Ah! And that's how we shave.
4451	"Ah, he's gonna sleep tonight."
4452	Are you snoring while you're awake?
4453	Mr. Burns? Where's he going?
4454	"Oh, it's for my Junior Achievers Club. We're trying to earn money by recycling."
4455	Ohh. Uhl. You can be Lisa's.
4456	"There's only one lifeguard whose name begins with ""M""!"
4457	"Um, it's the wiccan home page."
4458	"Really? I'm... ...cool? Oh, can I man-hug you?"
4459	Rural route 9? That's it! We can hide out at the farm where I grew up!
4460	I got the idea from the regular pen.
4461	"Hey... Hey, Lurleen! I've gotta say somethin' to ya."
4462	Lousy traffic jams. The traffic report'll get me outta this one.
4463	"Well, I'm not calling you a liar, but... but I can't think of a way to finish that sentence."
4464	"Shut up! Shut up! I'm a bad reader, okay?!"
4465	"Y'know, Marge, I've had my share of troubles but sitting here now with you and the kids, in our cozy home in this beautiful, free country, it just makes me feel that I'm really a lucky guy."
4466	"Okay, we'll go to the Chili Cook-Off. But I want you to promise me you won't have any beer."
4467	"Ah, that's better. How ya doin', Gertie?"
4468	"Homer one, New York nothing."
4469	I'll do no such thing! You're fired!
4470	"Agh. I've gotta run, or I'll miss the opening rank-out."
4471	"Get in the car -- and don't touch those guns, I just loaded 'em."
4472	Who here likes nostalgia?
4473	Okay... Place detection pad here... connect alarm hookup... there!
4474	"Oh, it-it's so great to see a kid using a wooden bat. These days it's all aluminum this and George W. that."
4475	"What? No, it's my dog!"
4476	A branch must've knocked out the power lines.
4477	Now I would like to sing our National Anthem.
4478	I'm talkin' about this guy.
4479	"Uh-huh. But this is the chair, right?"
4480	What the hell are you doing?
4481	"Quit it, Bart. Quit it. Quit it. Quit it. Mom, Bart's making faces."
4482	Homer looks into Marge's eyes.
4483	"But this is Grand Funk Railroad! You guys back there know Grand Funk, right?"
4484	Clueless little Lisa doesn't suspect a thing.
4485	"Hey, you're not fun, you're fat."
4486	"Dad, did you see anything provocative in today's paper?"
4487	Not for friends of Moe's.
4488	"Oh, Marge. I only said it because I thought that's what you wanted to hear."
4489	God bless those pagans.
4490	I think I just met the thing I'm gonna die on.
4491	"Come on, preen harder! Make them hate you! You feed on their hatred... and you are so hungry!"
4492	"CHERISH THAT FAMILY SMILE / PICKET FENCE DAYS GO SOMETHING SOMETHING / THE FUTURE IS COMING SOON / MOM AND DAD AND KIDS ARE SOMMMMETHING That's my favorite song now. Sorry ""Don't Fear the Reaper."" Everybody! Air guitar! Come on, do it with me! Use your whammy bar! Whew! Now fuzz it up! Excellent!"
4493	"You have a great day, ma'am."
4494	That's funny. I don't feel stupid.
4495	"Now let's start with the words everyone loves to hear: ""Welcome to Bible study!"""
4496	"Heh, heh, heh. Tremendous."
4497	WAIT RIGHT HERE FOR OUR ENCORE...
4498	"...so, killing people together has really spiced things up in the bedroom."
4499	That's even worse. Could you say it one more time?
4500	Tithe denied! Tithe denied!
4501	That's it -- game over.
4502	"When I get old, Marge, I want you to promise you'll put me in a home. It's like being a baby, only you're old enough to appreciate it."
4503	"He sure does, Uncle Herb."
4504	"Oh, that was uproarious. First-rate job, monkey!"
4505	Fievel was a mouse in a movie.
4506	"Shoo-shi-sha... Shoo... Sha... She... Shoo... Shoo, boy"
4507	"And I hate the cutesy way you make Jack-o-lanterns! I like scary Halloween, not funny Halloween!"
4508	"No, I'm here to have a little girl-talk with Mrs. Krabappel."
4509	Your first mission is to look out the window.
4510	"Oh, right, the nerve damage. Here's the benefit money -- now I'm gonna go vomit to keep my weight down. That's right, that's how Krusty does it."
4511	Don't you need training for that?
4512	I stole it from McBain after I cut off your father's thumb.
4513	"I already knew that, Dad. I'm gonna blame you."
4514	"Yeah, funny story. One day, I was really bored. And Dad had left the steam roller idling in the driveway..."
4515	Are you sure you're a fully accredited and bonded pornographer?
4516	"Here we are, 123 Fake Street. The home of knifey wifey."
4517	I'll have to check it out sometime.
4518	And stay in the living room. Don't go to their kids' room and watch a basketball game.
4519	"Oh, yeah. I'm a real expert."
4520	"Marge, we're responsible adults and..."
4521	I think it's time for us to go home.
4522	Bart and Lisa have to go to school while I get to stay home. Nyah nyah nyah nyah nyah nyah.
4523	"Oh, I know you're scared, Homie. But remember why you're doing this. It's for your father. The man who raised you and nurtured you."
4524	"Well, if it isn't Springfield's finest little babysitter, Lisa Simpson."
4525	"You'll be okay, Dad. Just make sure he hits you an even number of times so you don't end up with amnesia."
4526	"Dear Lord, thank you for Ziggy comics, little baby ducks, and ""Sweatin' to the Oldies,"" Volumes One, Two and Four."
4527	"Chill out dudes, it's me, Bart Simpson."
4528	"Interesting. When was the term ""shut up"" invented?"
4529	"I mean, I'll deal with those murderous trolls."
4530	I want to register to run for Sanitation Commissioner. And tell the fatcats upstairs -- things are gonna change in this town!
4531	"Hey, how are you. Nice to meet ya."
4532	Hey zombie -- wanna come out and play?
4533	"Lousy Bart... his money... All right, New York, I'm coming back. But you're not getting this!"
4534	Mommm! I have a fever!
4535	"I told you that if I let you into this movie, you couldn't make fun of me."
4536	"Boy, you can see everything from Mount Springfield. The Squidport, the old monorail..."
4537	I meant the other booby trap.
4538	"What do they do there, Dad?"
4539	Hands off the material!
4540	"Eh, you have any sugar around here?"
4541	Pull over. You're wanted for grand theft retirement home -- the TV remote is in your pocket!
4542	"We are a town of low-brows, no-brows and ignorami. We have eight malls but no symphony, thirty-two bars but no alternative theater, thirteen stores that begin with ""Le Sex..."" I write this letter not to nag or whine, but to prod! We can better ourselves!"
4543	"Bart, that's not funny."
4544	"Dad just got a library card in West Springfield. He checked out ten books on oil rigging and a book called ""Dying for Dummies."""
4545	Don't forget the unicorn!
4546	"Zounds, I did thee mightily smite-ly."
4547	"I've got you now, boy."
4548	Ooo... pointless nostalgia.
4549	"Oh Ned, I never dreamed that beneath those iddilies and diddilies there was a dude."
4550	"Da-ad! Oh, Dr. Hawking. We had such a beautiful dream. What went wrong?"
4551	Well these bills'll have to be paid out of your allowance.
4552	"Ooh, the Pharaoh's Chamber has a vibrating sarcophagus."
4553	You're not mad anymore?
4554	Dear Log: My worst fears have been confirmed. I've hit my mental and creative peak at the tender age of eight. What will my life be like after I descend into mediocrity?
4555	"I love your low prices, but why did these weddings get cancelled?"
4556	"Lookin' good, Santa's Little Hybrid."
4557	"Okay, but just 'cause I'm your best friend, don't be afraid to use that whip."
4558	Turn off that racket!
4559	"Nah, they wanted someone good. Story of my life."
4560	"Oh Lord, on this blessed day, we thank thee for giving our family one more crack at togetherness. Amen."
4561	We're here because our daughter is being bullied by your teacher.
4562	"Okay, Christmas, Christmas... you know how your paper boy always sends you a Christmas card with his home address on it? What's up with that?"
4563	"You know, Marge, this is just like when we were dating."
4564	Then we're goin' to Las Vegas! Which is actually back in that direction.
4565	"Hey -- if you want wild bears eating your children and scaring away your salmon, that's your business. But I'm not gonna take it! Who's with me?"
4566	It's like going to Hawaii without the murderous locals!
4567	"Oh, sorry, uh -- I'd tip you, but I don't have any cash."
4568	Did you raise the dead?
4569	"Well, it's better than my pistol."
4570	"But Marge, she never loses. She's got a gift. Aren't parents supposed to encourage their kids whenever they show talent?"
4571	Why is the TV back on? What happened to the videogame?
4572	"Fine. We'll both go. And if anybody asks you something you don't understand, just say, ""protons."""
4573	"You're my last-last chance, bottom of the barrel, Hail Mary, long shot, wish you would do it but probably won't, final resort, to lend me money."
4574	"Hey, Krusty! I'm bringing back the..."
4575	"But most of all, I remember the music."
4576	"You're worried about telling dad, aren't you, mom?"
4577	"Thanks for SpringFacing me your head cleaver, Bart."
4578	I've found a way we can pay for the operation.
4579	"Baby shower?! You know I haven't told Homer yet, and he'll be home any minute."
4580	"Don't worry, they're just getting the plot out of the way so it won't slow down the ."
4581	Maybe you'll run it in for a touchdown.
4582	"Young lady, this may be the high point of Bart's life. Cut him some slack."
4583	"Lisa, just take a bite. One bite -- that's all I ask!"
4584	It's so sterile! MyPods... MyPhones... A Brainiac Bar!
4585	"I will, when it's not sports season. I just want to know how the game ends."
4586	I invited Selma here to watch Grampa watch the kids.
4587	I'm going to be sore tomorrow.
4588	"He's not just some ""guy,"" Marge. He's a carny, and part of a noble tradition. Carnies built this country. The carnival part of it, anyway. And though they may be rat-like in appearance, they are truly kings among men."
4589	Maggie's a little hungry.
4590	"We made it, old friend!"
4591	"You're not going, and that's final."
4592	"But Bart, she threatened to cut off my allowance."
4593	The father of Lurleen Lumpkin?
4594	"Oh... I dunno... mixing drinks, picking horses, cuttin' cigars... you know -- a job."
4595	"They'll cheer a dancing octopus, but not an old man complaining about everything."
4596	"Okay, who needs another lamb rack?"
4597	"Stupid, non-magical son, can't pay to fix my car."
4598	"Aw, that's it. You just can't insult this guy. You call him a moron and he just sits there, grinning moronly."
4599	"Well, that's nice work, boys."
4600	He quit! Being a ref is a thankless job... the parents hate ya... the only upside is the kids share their snack with you.
4601	"Oh, yeah. My old friends, right next to my heart."
4602	"Sir, I believe that position was informally promised to me..."
4603	"Feelin' fine, well, that's a relief."
4604	"Listen Homer, uh... would you like to see my uh, my favorite place in the whole world?"
4605	"Sorry, but this is a highly sophistimicated doowhackey. If you don't use it responsibly... Kablamo!"
4606	Perhaps I can be of assistance!
4607	I thought you said Aunt Patty was just waiting for the right man.
4608	"Well, if I could explain myself..."
4609	"So that's how you see me? As a spineless, potato-cooking housewife who can't compete in the real world?"
4610	I'm too fat to fit in a foxhole.
4611	God you're hilarious.
4612	"Oh Lord, I have once again besotted my liver with thy fermented gifts. If you can weasel me out of this physical, I will blow your mind by doing something incredibly holy, at some point. Amen. Now to mumble in a religious fashion. Dear God, oh, Lord oh God, oh, Lord..."
4613	No more non-dice board games.
4614	"Guess what, Mom? I'm a cruciverbalist!"
4615	The queen's private surgeonnn!
4616	Big deal. You taught me to read one book.
4617	Not as long as I keep taking these.
4618	"Oh. Design your own power plant, eh? This is my chance to show everyone how professional I am."
4619	"I've gone through the town's financial records, and it turns out there are millions in uncollected city taxes."
4620	"The library? Bart, can you believe we're married to those nerds?"
4621	"Don't worry. I gave 'em a Pop Tart. The healthy kind, strawberry-frosted."
4622	"Homer, hold on to the wheel!"
4623	"Hey, hey, hey! Easy there, you big impostor."
4624	"You know, push people around, make ourselves feel big."
4625	This bed is making me nauseous. Why won't it stop?!
4626	"Hey, Michael. What happened to your voice?"
4627	"Why, thank you, Jack."
4628	Then came the day we knew we were finished.
4629	"Hey, how come you guys got better chairs than me?"
4630	"Sor-reee, your majesty."
4631	What? You can't take my Balderdash!
4632	"Mom, Dad, thank God you're okay."
4633	"Homer, what if this doesn't work?"
4634	"Yes, he had a brother robot named Rod, who was two space-years older than him."
4635	"You know, the great ones can kill without explaining."
4636	"Okay, I washed your car like you asked, I did your paper route, and I'm sorry. I really am. This could be the turning point of my life. Where you, as a school guy, made a difference. What do you think? Can I go on that sub?"
4637	"Well, well, if it isn't Frick and Frack, Jack and Jill, Fred and Ethel, the Three..."
4638	"Goodnight kids, and don't forget Krusty loves you!"
4639	Wait a minute... she's right!
4640	"Now maybe a little joke, to break the ice."
4641	This is for your show's slight decline in quality over the years!
4642	So profit margins will be thinner than Louise Brooks' negligee.
4643	Wait for it... wait for it...
4644	"Oh, you don't say? What about that history test?... Huh? Piece of cake, huh? So listen, what'd you get for Number one? Uh huh. Number two?... Oh yeah, that sounds right."
4645	"Homer, you're still here? You should've left for work an hour ago!"
4646	"Oh-ho, put down your stick. We're here to work."
4647	"Okay, remember our deal: everyone gets to return one Christmas present with no hurt feelings. I'm returning this kitten calendar."
4648	Mona cheated on me?! I don't know how she found the time with her late-night pottery classes and supermarket trips that took all weekend.
4649	"Hm, how about a fist bump through a towel."
4650	"Dad, that line was in the cartoon."
4651	"All right, all right. Come on, Bart."
4652	"Well, you see, boy. It never hurts to grease the wheels a little."
4653	"But I want to learn a dance I can use in real life, like the Tango de la Muerte."
4654	Yeah! Gimme all the dirt!
4655	But where are we going to put him?
4656	"Oh, but Lenny just got some bottle rockets."
4657	"Okay, here's the plan. You can move in with your sisters and raise the kids. And I'll... die in a gutter. It's practical and within our means."
4658	"Eh, I never got that show."
4659	He was gravely wounded in a bank shootout.
4660	You little... Ruff! Ruff! Ruff!
4661	Is that women's underwear?
4662	"Hey, there's still time. Let's hug him again."
4663	Last day of scho-ol! Last day of scho-ol! Found my summer hob-by! Banging pots togeth-er!
4664	I love ya! I love ya! I love ya!
4665	How's it feel when the hoax is on the other foot?
4666	"Marge, we're not going to have to worry about money ever again. Because I've got a plan..."
4667	"What? Eh. Eh. Let me handle the creative end of this, Marge. You don't understand how the creative mind works like I do."
4668	My poem has become an elegy. An elegy no one will ever hear.
4669	"Yeah. Another day, another box of stolen pens."
4670	"Honey, he's nuts. He thinks he's handsome. Please, make him look handsome. Please, please, please, please..."
4671	What's therapy gonna do for me when the world is in ashes?
4672	I'll do it this afternoon...
4673	"Ooh, a good old-fashioned lemon party! I call first squeeze!"
4674	Mom! Bart took what I said and turned it into an insult!
4675	CALL MR. PLOW / THAT'S MY NAME / THAT NAME AGAIN IS / MR. PLOW.
4676	"Homer, there's no rear on that thing."
4677	"Bart, what famous historical figure do you want to write about?"
4678	"Sport, dear, it's a sport, you silly thing."
4679	"Homer, can you run some lines with me?"
4680	"Those royal elephants have trainers to keep 'em in shape. Average schmoe like me, forget it."
4681	"C'mon, Dad. Let's go."
4682	"Well, Dad, what do you want to talk about tonight?"
4683	"Homie, maybe you should stop. We've talked about the gray zone..."
4684	Fifty dollars? What about all the water you guys will waste with your bathing and showering and washing your clothes?
4685	"Mom, this gravy tastes better than God's sweat."
4686	"Kids, that cartoon's not life-affirming. We're going to watch a show about the everyday problems of angels."
4687	"Bart, you're just like Chilly, the elf who cannot love."
4688	Hurry up. I can't stand here jabbing you all day.
4689	"Maybe later. Come on, Ralph -- your Dad's a cop. There must be some cool stuff around here. Bullets, dead body photos, what have you."
4690	"Dad, is that story really true?"
4691	"You know, I don't know."
4692	Oh my gosh. It's the mascot from the 1924 games in Chamonix!
4693	Kiss it and make it boogie!
4694	Very well. I'm not gonna be Angry Dad for one day longer. I'm giving up anger forever!
4695	"Dad, I've got the perfect thing."
4696	"Oh, praise God, you're alive! Unless..."
4697	"Hmmm, I see... I sure hope they don't have an ice cream round."
4698	"Oh, I'm afraid Lenny's dead."
4699	"Oo, that's a noodle scratcher."
4700	This is an angry sleepover. I'm only doin' it 'cause it was on the books.
4701	It seems that most of the animals are sleeping.
4702	"Well, here we are at the Brad Goodman lecture."
4703	"I'll always love you, Bart. Springfield baby! Springfield baby!"
4704	"Well, I spend a lot of time on the couch..."
4705	"You see, Ned... your city-wide nagging compressed all of our town's misbehavior into one small place...creating a glittering diamond of super evil."
4706	Unsatisfying sex life?
4707	I have a Jewish imaginary friend. Her name is Rachel Cohen and she just got into Brandeis.
4708	"Dear Marge, how are you? I am fine. The waves here are way bigger than the ones at home. And the salt water is rising. What's next? Pepper water? Ha ha. Love ya, Homer Simpson."
4709	"Again? Homer, we have to ration the water carefully. It's our only hope."
4710	Almost. Just give her another twenty minutes.
4711	"Hmm... ""Cosby's first law of intergenerational perversity: No matter what you tell your child to do, he will always do the opposite."" Huh?"
4712	"I am, and you seem more interested in my day than my husband!"
4713	I have eaten the ribs of God.
4714	Quick -- press against me while the ink's still wet!
4715	"Well, crying isn't going to bring him back, unless your tears smell like dog food. So you can either sit there, crying and eating can after can of dog food until your tears smell enough like dog food to make your dog come back, or you can go out there and find your dog!"
4716	Femmmmm! Wah! Gnnn! Hrmmerhrr!
4717	Looks like all you're teaching is obnoxiousness and poor sportsmanship.
4718	"Thank you for the tour of your factory, Mister Wonka."
4719	Although it was suspiciously pro-lawnmower.
4720	How come I can't join the army but Lisa gets to be in PETA?
4721	"Well, then we've got a problem. The banks are closed by now."
4722	"Together, we survived the Depression, won a few wars, and put a man on the moon. In fact, the only mistake our generation made was creating that generation."
4723	What about Abe Simpson? Don't you have any feelings for him?
4724	Are you gonna eat that all by yourself?
4725	Yes I am. And it would be nice to have a little privacy around here for a change.
4726	"At least you need me, sack of potatoes."
4727	Homer! How'd you get in here?
4728	"That's them. Now remember everyone, be understanding and forgiving for the sake of family unity."
4729	"Come on, Dad! Just a few more feet! Show 'em what you got!"
4730	"Look, all I ask is that you be fair."
4731	"You're not flushing those springs down our toilet, are you?"
4732	"I've got to apologize. Once again, sleeping at work has saved my marriage!"
4733	"Hold still, sweetie. Daddy will kill it. And this time no screw-ups."
4734	Summon my son at once!
4735	Now? Do you forgive me now? Now? Now?
4736	"Why you little... I'll give you a goodnight kiss you'll never forget! C'mere, you!"
4737	Reverend! Reverend! They took Homer!
4738	"Homer Simpson, sir. One of the carbon blobs from Sector 7G. But I don't think..."
4739	"/ THOSE EYES ARE GEMS BEYOND APPRAISAL / STUNNING SHADE OF PUREST... Oh, what is it?! I was so close! Let's see, what rhymes with appraisal: basil, nasal -- none of these are colors! Oh, it's hopeless! She'll never love me again."
4740	"Homer, my audition is in half..."
4741	"I can't believe it, it's sticking. You're telling me new stuff, and minutes later it's still there! And it's all thanks to you. Marge, when I see you forming the vowels and continents --"
4742	The cemetery? And you're just sitting here?
4743	I just felt a chill go through my very soul.
4744	It sure has. You see this bulge back here?
4745	"Ah, your flesh mother used to bring me pudding. Oh, I miss Marge. Lisa you're smart. Help me trick her into taking me back."
4746	Get my homework from Mrs. Hoover.
4747	"Okay, okay, calm down."
4748	It's not my fault! Lousy magnet.
4749	"There's been a change of plans. I was gonna tell you, but then I remembered... you're the rat!"
4750	Mmm... hmm... That's not bad.
4751	"I'm really sorry. I kinda traded your soul to the guy at the comic book store. But look, I got some cool POGS."
4752	"Son, we're in this mess together. No matter how tempting it might be, I can't let my only boy get ripped limb from limb by a blood-thirsty mob."
4753	"Hey, mon. I call for a ""joint"" session. This vote is ""dreadlocked."""
4754	"But baby, a man has needs."
4755	Hear Me Roar -- The Network For Women.
4756	"There's a $10,000 bill in it for you."
4757	Bah! To hell with this! Get my razor! Draw a bath! And get these Kleenex boxes off my feet!
4758	"Well Homer, now that you're alive again, I'll leave you with your real family."
4759	There's never a bright side!
4760	"Homer, you embarrassed us in front of the whole congregation, and today's sermon was one you should have really listened to."
4761	"There can only be one truly great music festival a lifetime, and it's the US Festival."
4762	"A simple ""yes"" would've sufficed."
4763	"Man, Moe's barely got two nickels to rub together."
4764	I wanna hear about old-time wrestling too.
4765	Grampa must've set them free!
4766	"Yes, but he thought that was a bad thing."
4767	"Goodbye, stupid Earth!"
4768	Rock stars. Is there anything they don't know?
4769	I guess we better get used to being pariahs.
4770	"Aw, thanks for your honesty, Apu. Is there any other product in the store you'd like to warn me about?"
4771	Appear in Summer Stock Play...
4772	"When I was in special ops, they held me in an Afghan prison where all I could see was a patch of blue sky. But that blue was nothing compared to the blue of your eyes."
4773	"How could you, Barney? After all I've done for you."
4774	"Boy, this is easy. Maybe I am the world's greatest acrobat."
4775	"Oh, I'm so glad we were able to get together."
4776	Baaart! You're wrecking it! LET GO! I worked forever on this!
4777	So I guess we're enemies again.
4778	Why? So I can watch my wife spend the rest of her life in the arms of another man? I don't think so. Good day.
4779	"Krusty, you gotta help us."
4780	Hm. That is the kind of nonsense you're always falling for.
4781	"Marge, we came to an appointment in the middle of the day. That's the most a parent can do."
4782	"Oh, son. I like you more, now that other people like you."
4783	"Negatively, I assume."
4784	"Yes, it's the preferred term. And most scientists believe that what enters a black hole never comes out. But some think they may be a gateway to other universes."
4785	I had to take care of his hounds for a year.
4786	"Oh Bart, you got me the fluffy pet I've never stopped thinking about!"
4787	I'm so sick of Gil... he ruins Thanksgiving... uses my leg razor to peel his carrots...
4788	I have misplaced my pants.
4789	"Bart, a school-sponsored Medieval festival is supposed to be the best day of a young girl's life, and you ruined it. You deserve to be expelled."
4790	"No Dad, it's just the weather."
4791	"I'm so proud of you, Mr. Burns! You're getting your fortune back and you're doing it without endangering the planet or cozying up to the Aspen crowd."
4792	Oh yeah. It's a parking lot out there.
4793	Were you or Lenny ever named sexiest man alive?
4794	"Oh, I can't believe they took ""Monkey Trauma Center"" off for this."
4795	"Homer! Just because everyone else is doing the wave, doesn't mean you have to!"
4796	What if he wants to hold hands?
4797	"Excuse me, we're trying to find ""CafÃ© Artiste."""
4798	"Marge, lighten up. Even Grampa's enjoying himself."
4799	"C'mon, open it open it open it."
4800	A Chuck E. Cheese token?
4801	"You're up to something, aren't you?"
4802	"Ew, you used my bracelet for a nose ring!"
4803	"Homer, you left two jobs and bought an ambulance without even a phone call."
4804	"Handle first, handle first..."
4805	But try tellin' that to Killy McGee up there.
4806	I'll do whatever it takes.
4807	"Cripes, man, can't you ever get to the green in less than two shots?"
4808	"No problem, we'll say you were on a fact finding mission."
4809	And that's what I believe in now.
4810	"Hey, wait up! We gotta swap insurance info!"
4811	"Wait, I have an idea! One of us can go undercover as a nun and infiltrate the convent."
4812	But what if they try to talk us into something?
4813	"Oh and that sauce, Barney. I could have drunk a bowl of it by itself! No Barney, that's just my sister-in-law."
4814	We want a catcher / Not a belly scratcher!
4815	"Sir, do you know what this means? He is alive."
4816	Sounds like a pretty crappy game to me.
4817	"Now children, you can have one piece of candy tonight and save the rest for..."
4818	"How can you believe all this mumbo-jumbo? The bucket came off Dad's head because the bright lights heated it, causing the metal to expand."
4819	"Yeah, it's a crummy system, but what are you gonna do?"
4820	"Bart, there's something I have to tell you father to son. I passed out on your turtle and killed it. Someday you'll thank me."
4821	That chair might be the only one he made.
4822	"Hm, let's hitch a ride with that hick."
4823	Oo! Oo! I want to see Lobster Boy and Shrimp Girl!
4824	You can't close! I'll have to go home and drink better beer at half the price in natural lighting!
4825	I'll tell you what I think. I think he thinks I'm an idiot. The only reason he's offering us this is because he knows he's gonna lose the trial and have to pay us a cool million.
4826	Hey! My dad worked really hard to make that. He took a class to learn denim painting!
4827	I could use some help!
4828	"See you after the game, when you're a big star."
4829	What position is this?
4830	"So hard to resist. Mesquite-grilled onions... jalapeÃ±o relish... Wait a minute, those are Southwestern ingredients!"
4831	"No, no, no! Musk, you tricked me!"
4832	"Stole, made-up, what's the difference?"
4833	Everything's a flavor in the kitchens of today!
4834	This car looks a little small. Is the engine powerful?
4835	Hm. It feels like food. But it has no flavor whatsoever.
4836	"Now let's see, twenty minutes at three hundred degrees is the equivalent of five minutes at... twelve hundred degrees."
4837	How could this have happened?
4838	"Face it, we're just kids. We can't afford stuff with zeroes in the prices. All we have in the world are the things our parents give us."
4839	Where are you taking me?
4840	"Woo woo! The H stands for Herbert! Herb, were you adopted?"
4841	With one little difference.
4842	Sure is hot back here.
4843	Work!? But you're hippies!
4844	"Oh my God, he's out of frame! Zoom out! Zoom out!"
4845	"She smells sheet smells by the sheet store. Wait, wait. Lemme try it again."
4846	Sally Circle was eating donuts and Ovaltine when her father came in with terrible news.
4847	I guess killing will be fun enough.
4848	Maybe you just dreamed it.
4849	"Credit card offer, overdue bill... credit card offer, overdue bill... huh, what's this?"
4850	"On Main Street, turn right now... / Our Sunday drive is ruined! Hands at ten and two!"
4851	"No! I've gotta pass this class for my kids. Son, let's stop the fussin' and a-feudin'."
4852	Wait. I'm remembering something...
4853	Let me just download the complete works of Shakespeare.
4854	"Well, I always knew you'd change the world, for the better."
4855	"Yeah, well I have full tenure."
4856	I'll explain later. Strad! Come back! I know you're in there!
4857	"Myth: It's only fair to pay for quality first-run movies. Fact: Most movies shown on cable get two stars or less and are repeated ad nauseam. Hmm, well, I don't know."
4858	"All right, I remember we all got in... and by the way, that backseat is pretty tight for the kids. I mean, I don't know what we'd do if we had another baby. With this car, we're basically saying no more babies!"
4859	"It's like we're at Cheers. I loved that show. Because you always knew it was only a half hour till ""Wings."" Then you could just sleep till Monday."
4860	"Do you two have to sit so close to the TV? Back up, or it'll hurt your eyes."
4861	"Does the pizza guy take a check? If so, where do we keep the checks? And lastly, how do you write a check?"
4862	"No thank you, I'd rather push this button."
4863	"Hey, I just zinged you."
4864	"Not this time, you won't. This is your third strike. First you torched that orphanage, then you blew up that bus full of nuns..."
4865	I've lost my guinea pig!
4866	"Uh, just a few Venn diagrams."
4867	"You know, we could get equipment like this through a bond issue."
4868	"Look, why don't you two settle down. I'm sure you can get another pillow."
4869	And a little mincing would be nice.
4870	"Oh. Well, it's time to start telling the truth. Now, when I have to tell my husband the truth, I cook him a big delicious dinner. By the time he's done eating, he's too full and tired to care what I have to say."
4871	"Hello. As you may know, I might not be around much longer, so I've decided to give you your inheritance before I die, that way I can see you enjoy it. Lisa, I know you like reading and... so forth... To you I give you my lifetime of personal correspondence."
4872	I'm sure Lurleen will love it.
4873	"Yeah, it's like the Allman Brothers!"
4874	"Can you take me to school, Krusty?"
4875	Why don't you kids come trick-or-treating with Maggie and me?
4876	There is a part of our past that we haven't told you kids about. A turbulent part.
4877	"Sir, that's two years from now and you're not supposed to tell anyone."
4878	I suppose it could be almost anybody...
4879	Just stick it in the refrigerator when you're done. Bart. Bart?
4880	Bart Simpson's office.
4881	"Now, Lisa, listen to me. This is important. I want you to smile today."
4882	"Don't worry! Our dog'll find my Dad! We need you, boy!"
4883	"Don't worry, piggy, you made the right choice."
4884	This is the best Year of the Rat ever!
4885	"Hello, are you Royce Lumpkin?"
4886	"Oh, well, that's good... Oh."
4887	You wanted to see me?
4888	"Just, just let me get--"
4889	"Oh, that'll learn 'im."
4890	That's him all right. I'll be happy to take him off your hands.
4891	"Now that you're all relaxed... Most of us here were born in America. We take this country for granted. But not immigrants like Apu. While the rest of us are drinking ourselves stupid, they're driving the cabs that get us home safely..."
4892	There's always a catch.
4893	That sounds horrible!
4894	"Ooh, the FutureSphere. It's what people in nineteen sixty-five imagined what life would be like in nineteen eighty-seven."
4895	"Argh, that smells worse than James Coco's ski boots!"
4896	"Grampa, that's the noblest thought that's ever been expressed at this table."
4897	"You su-diddily-uck, Flanders! Gimme that!"
4898	"Where's Mag-gie? Where's Mag-gie? Hey, where is she?"
4899	It looks like an amusement park.
4900	They wrote all the songs on Maggie's baby records.
4901	GONNA DRINK AMMONIA / 'CAUSE IT TASTES LIKE CHEESE / WONDER WHAT WILL HAPPEN...
4902	When did you come up with the idea? You must've worked on it for days.
4903	"Hmm... Dad said he was going to ""unite all faiths."" And only one site is sacred to Muslims, Christians and Jews -- The Dome of the Rock!"
4904	They also have Memorial Day.
4905	That's my Italian tutor!
4906	"So Milhouse got the redemption he deserved... and so, in a way, did Bart."
4907	"Yeah, you're right, Moe. You're always Moe."
4908	What's a MacGyver and why does it have a convention?
4909	But the cans seal in the flavor.
4910	TIS THE SEASON TO BE JOLLY...
4911	"That's right, I'm down to my wife-blesser."
4912	"I'm not, it's my ringtone."
4913	"And I gave that man directions, even though I didn't know the way. 'Cause that's the kind of guy I am this week."
4914	"Welcome, come in. Ah, fresh victims for my ever-growing army of the undead."
4915	"Oh yeah, you're out of nails."
4916	"Dad, this is our pet. We can question his integrity and disposition, but we can't question his heart. Are you trying to teach us that the way to solve a problem with something you love is to throw it away?"
4917	"Uh, Ralph's a little afraid of the dark, Bart. Is it okay to sleep with a night-light?"
4918	"Guys, the thing is, we totally have the money. And we tried to wire it to you, but you know how banks screw up."
4919	"Bart, two, three, four! You put my Dad in jail, flip, spin, twirl!"
4920	He looks and acts just like the dealer. I think they're related or at least in cahoots.
4921	"Homer, get up! Up, up, up!"
4922	What if I just taught you how to whistle?
4923	I told you I don't have anything.
4924	"Hi-diddly ho, neighbor."
4925	The best performance of my life.
4926	This is not the evening I envisioned.
4927	Now see here! You are so not the heartless automatons I was looking for! There's one thing man has that machines can never match: hounds!
4928	Everything's work with you. Lighten up.
4929	IT'S THE AMERICAN WAYYY!
4930	Your pick of roles in the prison musical. This year I think it's Man of La Mancha.
4931	"Rules: no men, no cell phones, no mirrors, no shame."
4932	"C'mon, Doc. There's gotta be something I can do to help my dad."
4933	"Give Daddy the remote, Maggie. Give daddy the..."
4934	"Uh, maybe I should be going. I caught you at a bad time."
4935	No! It was Bleeding Gums Murphy.
4936	"All right, we're back in business."
4937	"Come on, I'll get you the tickets."
4938	So love at first sight is possible.
4939	Now remember Bart. This is a religious school. So be very careful about what you say and do here.
4940	"Dad, that could explode!"
4941	Sure kid. Get in line.
4942	"Well, well, well. Looks like we've got ourselves a showdown, boy."
4943	"Homer, we're picking up cel phone calls over the baby monitor!"
4944	A place where you'll never be bothered by your family again.
4945	"Now they're aggressive again! I'm sure there's a correlation, but could there be a... causation?"
4946	"Hm, now without lettuce."
4947	How could you make me Baby Stink Breath and not even tell me?
4948	Me? A professional baker's employee? Imagine how different my life would be!
4949	I'm going to find that golden ticket and win that tour! The only thing that can make bacon more delicious is seeing how it's made!
4950	"Marge, you tie up the bathroom every morning. I've got to wash my hair."
4951	"Yes I did! I heard ""competitive eater""!"
4952	"We were gonna treat you to dinner at an upscale chain restaurant and never explain why, but now forget it!"
4953	"And with that, a mighty cheer went up from the heroes of Springfield. They had brought the sacred tree back to its native soil, and though Flanders was stuck with the impound fee, he could easily afford it."
4954	"I'm sorry, Homer. Have you thought about what you want to tell the kids?"
4955	"Oh yes, Lisa, very seriously. Whee."
4956	"I think we're following you. What's your species, little guy?"
4957	I think it distracts people from more important social issues.
4958	I dunno. There's something about this noose I just don't like.
4959	"All right, sister. What's your game?"
4960	This is awesome! If only real life was in 3-D.
4961	"I've been waiting for this day for so long. The year is nineteen forty-six. In a war-torn world, a single flower blooms. And that flower is an angry Japanese monster named Godzilla. How am I doin', Dad?"
4962	We're here to eat your kids.
4963	"I'm gonna say this for the last time: Bart, if this is one of your pranks, very funny."
4964	"The electric chair is on, eh? Then the old prison has been getting free electricity for thirty years. I'll put a stop to that."
4965	"Oh, I believe you, but Flanders' drill doesn't."
4966	"Ooh, look at that. Ooh, gingerbread house. Hansel and Gretel are set for life."
4967	"Except you, you and you."
4968	Should I have my father arrested?
4969	Oh I'll come back all right. And I'll bring my husband to do a little malpractice on you.
4970	This is my favorite kind of surprise: mild!
4971	"Some of us still enjoy scripted comedy, sir."
4972	"Hey, how ya been? Remember me?"
4973	No. We need help. And there's only one man who can get us out of a jam like this.
4974	I hear ya. Come on boy.
4975	"Don't worry -- I'm ready for this. Bart, fetch ""The Defender."""
4976	Huh? This isn't Miss Hoover's class.
4977	"I don't want a date! And I don't want to wear perfume and cocktail dresses! Am I the only one who just wants to play hopscotch, and bake cookies, and watch ""The McLaughlin Group?"""
4978	I guess we're not going to find anyone.
4979	"You mean I get 5% off on everything in the store just because I look like... I mean, just because I am Krusty the clown?"
4980	Eep! Leave me alone! Go swab Begley. He likes it!
4981	You know who the real victim is in all this? Milhouse.
4982	"Hey, hey, kids. Let's hear it for Madame Mimi and her Cheese-Seeking Poodles!"
4983	"A high school principal has decided that football is too dangerous, so he's replacing it with soccer!"
4984	Here comes Santa Claus / Here comes Santa Claus / Right down Santa Claus Lane... Vixen and Blitzen all the reindeer pulling at the reins... / Oh what fun it is to ride in a one horse open sleigh...
4985	"Please don't leave me, George."
4986	"Well, this year's gonna be different."
4987	"Well, my room is my sanctuary. My family knows that and respects that."
4988	Can I get extra credit for a caveman break dance?
4989	COME GATHER 'ROUND CHILDREN / IT'S HIGH-TIME YE LEARNS / 'BOUT A HERO NAMED HOMER / AND A DEVIL NAMED BURNS / WE'LL MARCH TILL WE DROP / THE GIRLS AND THE FELLAS / WILL FIGHT TILL THE DEATH OR ELSE FOLD LIKE UMBRELLAS
4990	Confidence is so attractive in a man.
4991	"Yup, Delaware's got it all."
4992	"First, it wasn't 25 years. It was 27 years. And second, she had a very good reason."
4993	"Here's my angle: there's no way in God's Heaven I should get into God's Heaven. But maybe he'll let me in, if I warn others the Apocalypse is coming, as I previously shouted."
4994	I don't suppose you'd consider taking your old job back so Homie can go back to his old job?
4995	This is my husband...
4996	Then all that's left is to protect Maggie from the sun.
4997	Can't even go in my own kitchen... Bart's in there right now licking frosting off my eggbeaters.
4998	"... And when ye tallow hardens, we remove it from yon mold."
4999	"Don't worry, honey. You can win without him."
5000	"But Marge, Alan Thicke is throwing knives at Ricardo Montalban."
5001	"Gotcha. Can't win, don't try."
5002	"Nelson, you really have a knack for this."
5003	Mom! Mom! We know where Dad is!
5004	"There's this guy that got killed -- I think it was in Miami? So C.S.I. Miami investiga-ted-ed it. Then a family said how much they loved the Olive Garden. Then I fell asleep. When I woke up, Letterman was talking to Alias."
5005	What are you talking about?
5006	You must be the most boring woman on earth.
5007	"My lame-o sister, Lisa."
5008	"Oh no no, she says lots of words. Like when she wants something, she says"
5009	That is one bitchin' bike!
5010	Lollygags... slackabouts... Captain Happys... you're all fired!
5011	"Well, whaddaya think?"
5012	"And as if that film wasn't enough, we have a special guest: why, it's Curtis E. Bear, the Courtesy Bear!"
5013	"Bart faced a terrible choice: take a beating with his friend or slither off like a coward. And like he did with every multiple choice question he ever saw, Bart chose ""B."""
5014	Okay. I'll bring you back an eye care pamphlet.
5015	"Well, that's not quite true--"
5016	"Hey Marge, looking for something? I'm looking for something too -- a bell pepper I don't like. Maybe it'll be this one."
5017	That's a risk I'm willing to take. So long!
5018	"Bart, I'll find a way to get you out of this wedding. In the meantime, just say yes, so Lou will be safe -- look how happy he is."
5019	I will get you one now!
5020	Is it some place I have to put on a tie?
5021	No! Don't talk like that! There's always hope.
5022	"Well, the rest of your life for sure."
5023	"Thanks for the history lesson, sis."
5024	I don't want your pity booze. I'll pay for it myself.
5025	"Homer, tell your child what you bought when I sent you to town to get some insurance."
5026	"Okay, but I'm buyin'."
5027	It's one of those campy 70's throwbacks that appeals to Generation X'ers.
5028	"Well I, uh, found that contact lens I was missing. Lemme just screw her back in."
5029	After everything I did you're going to abandon me?
5030	How many yum-yum fish did we get?
5031	The light! We gotta get the light back on!
5032	I wish I'd never met you!
5033	"Hey, Fat Tony! You still with the Mafia?"
5034	"Maybe I can finally meet Jim Jarmusch and ask him who he is. Hey, that's him!"
5035	"The Rolling Stones Rock 'n' Roll Fantasy Camp!! But I thought you guys were mad at me. For once in my life, I'm confused."
5036	"I saw you yesterday in the dining room, and I didn't know if I should say ""hi"" or not."
5037	What a magical party this has been. Mr. Burns is a great man.
5038	"Hear ye, hear ye, everybody makes mistakes. Let's go home."
5039	"Oh, I see. You hate him, so you gave him to the church."
5040	"Dr. Fredrick J. Waxman, you're a genius!"
5041	We're gonna miss Christmas!
5042	"Homer, use your inside voice."
5043	"Oh, I wish I had someplace to call my own. No one wants me around any more."
5044	"C'mon, Chalmie. You fired Skinner for less than this."
5045	Who'd want candy filled with laxatives?
5046	"Oh, hi little girl. What brings you to see Uncle Krusty?"
5047	"Please, Dad. This argument humiliates us both."
5048	"Wait Dad! Good news, everyone! You don't have to eat meat. I made enough Gazpacho for all!"
5049	When Trent Steel bought me some.
5050	"Oh, bad dog! Bad dog!"
5051	"Please don't go, Bart. I'll let you swear in the house. Everything but the big three."
5052	"No. I'm not a smart nerd, I'm just a weak nerd."
5053	"Yeah, and he collects toy robots!"
5054	"Well boy, looks like you've got yourself a roommate."
5055	"This Saturday, from the Dad who brought you ""cemetery paintball"" and ""go-karts on real roads,"" comes the greatest activity yet..."
5056	"Marge, it's three a.m. and I worked all day!"
5057	"I don't do things that way, Lisa."
5058	My favorite is Chicago deep dish.
5059	Come on! Just pick one!
5060	"Lisa, what are you doing? This is the kind of troublemaking I expect from your brother."
5061	I'm beginning to think this alumni party was just a ruse to get our money.
5062	No one told me the plant was closed!
5063	"You gotta get me closer, Chief!"
5064	Hey Marge -- what were your gambling losses last year?
5065	I think I'll unplug that.
5066	I call this meeting of the Brotherhood of the Spectacles to order. Our mission: to get Chalmers back his job.
5067	"Help! Help us! They stole our uniforms, guns and tasers!"
5068	Shoo! Shoo! Shoo! Shoo! Shoo! Shoo! Shoo!
5069	"Ooh, the touch of death."
5070	"Whoa, this is gonna be the coolest basketball game ever!"
5071	Grampa always hated Bongo and loved money so he sold Bongo to a wicked farm witch just so he could hang out with a bunch of rich dogs and kidnapped Santa so I'd never get the toy I actually wanted--
5072	"You don't need a Wii now that I'm here. Because you and me make ""us."""
5073	"Mom, can't a man do something nice for his loved ones?"
5074	"Oh, the prid is gone."
5075	"Well, I want you to go over to their house and apologize!"
5076	Don't tell me how many times to think!
5077	We want to sue the sugar industry for selling a harmful product.
5078	This party's great. But all I wish is that I was drinking a beer with my kids right now.
5079	King of the neighborhood!
5080	"Hmm... reclusive millionaire, stately mansion, damaged psyche. He's just like me!"
5081	"Kids, there's something I have to tell you -- your mother and I are wetting the bed."
5082	"Ah, too much aggravation! We just forego flipped food!"
5083	Um-hmmm. Who called the police?
5084	... move your joystick to the left.
5085	I'm lost and I'm starving!
5086	"Bart, I'm not thrilled either. But one day we might need each other for organ transplants, so we'd better keep the lines of communication open. Want to help me with my ant farm?"
5087	Stop it! You're killing me! Seattle...
5088	I'll be there. And this time you can be the nacho man.
5089	TV's gotten so lousy.
5090	"I'm not afraid, I'm not afraid, I'm not..."
5091	Around the loop of death...And out the mail slot! Then it's the yard's problem.
5092	"Oh, uh, I'd better take this. Y'see, Moe's been depressed and needs to hear a friendly voice. Why the hell are you calling me at home, you moron?!"
5093	"Hmm, this is an interesting old book."
5094	YVAN EHT NIOJ. Ya gotta love that crazy chorus.
5095	D'Artagnan wasn't a musketeer! He only had a letter of introduction to the captain of the guards -- which he lost!
5096	"The burgers are getting cold, guys. Holy moly."
5097	Three: You seem to be of the Jewish faith.
5098	"Ah, cartoons, America's only native art form. I don't count jazz, 'cause it sucks."
5099	"Well, I pictured cocktail parties and candle-lit dinners. I pictured napkins... Homer, I want to throw a dinner party."
5100	"You know me, Marge: I like my beer cold, my TV loud, and my homosexuals fla-ming."
5101	"You're a little light here, Dad."
5102	I'll show you how to clean out an office!
5103	"Oh good, she's here in time to see us die!"
5104	"Thanks for bringing me here, Dad. I'll remember this day on my deathbed."
5105	"Oh, yes, sitting. The great leveler. From the mightiest Pharaoh to the lowliest peasant, who doesn't enjoy a good sit?"
5106	"No, Dad, it's to fight soil erosion."
5107	"Mom, look! I found something more fun than complaining!"
5108	"Dad, I don't understand. After all the corruption and deceit we've witnessed, how can everyone just party?"
5109	"Hear ye, hear ye, my daughter has something to tell you about Jebediah Springfield."
5110	Thanks for understanding.
5111	"Friday night, pork chops. From cradle to grave... etched in stone in God's library somewhere..."
5112	"Oh, I can't take money from a neighbor. Although, business at the Leftorium's been pretty slow since that big chain store came to town."
5113	"What did those women expect? When you sign a contract with Fox, you know you're gonna be betrayed and humiliated."
5114	And she's ready for a night of anonymous sex with multiple partners.
5115	"Thanks, Bart. This'll make a lot of arctic loons very happy."
5116	Do you realize what this means?
5117	I want you to shut off the logical part of your mind.
5118	Oh my God. Simon set me up. And all this time I thought he wanted the life of a stranger he met in the bathroom.
5119	How can an iron be a landlord?
5120	He ruined her first Wordloaf!
5121	"It's just not a dinner party without a melon baller. And we'll need a citrus zester... a ravioli crimper... Ooh, an oyster mallet! ""Made in U.S.A.""? Eh, no thank you!"
5122	"Moe? Hey, Moe? Oh, you're thinking about all the money you blew, aren'tcha?"
5123	"Your mother must have painted this. I guess she thought he was cute... Hey, what the..."
5124	"C'mon Marge, I'm not the only selfish person. You have to get your hair done at ""Supercuts."" I guess regular ""Cuts"" just isn't good enough for you."
5125	"Oh, hi, kids. Thanks."
5126	Today you were truly a hero. Thank you.
5127	Isn't there anything we can do?
5128	"It's true -- I've given up everything but raisins. And the doctor says they're killin' me. Sweet, plump coffin nails is what they are."
5129	"What's your Nostalgia Prize, Grampa?"
5130	I really didn't want it to come to this...
5131	"Lis, I think I'm having a midlife crisis."
5132	"Oh, uh, Roz, I have to step out for one hour and forty-three minutes. Could you cover for me?"
5133	"Oh, I'm so bored! Maybe I'll clean out my wallet."
5134	"There's Clinton, Bush Senior, and the nice guy who finished last, Jimmy himself."
5135	Some guys just can't take crocodiles.
5136	"Ah relax, I'm over it. Why aren't you at the block party?"
5137	"C'mon, Becky. Tell us your big news."
5138	Need a unit production manager?
5139	Neither did I. I didn't want to know what color the Statue of Liberty was. But you know what? I was wrong. And these ladies are too.
5140	Quirky? Quirky is a grandma who gives people the finger! You made us look like monsters!
5141	"Okay, so what are you?"
5142	"Hey, this pen's gotta last me all day. Now, if you could, up bup bup bup bup bup bup... ...Yeah."
5143	Oh come on. What kind of big fat moron would fall for...
5144	"Young man, would you like a lemon drop?"
5145	"Thank you. Although, I think the worst thing that ever happened to my husband was joining your group."
5146	"Excuse me, have you seen this man?"
5147	Good. Good. One more.
5148	"I put it in a safe place, Marge. I mean, what are the odds the boy would look in the vegetable crisper?"
5149	"Well, if kids are so innocent, why is everything bad named after them? Acting childish. Kidnapping. Child abuse..."
5150	"Mrs. Simpson, may I take you for an evening drive? Our loaner awaits!"
5151	"I'm good for the rest, you know I am."
5152	"Phht, that's just an old wives tale."
5153	You'd do that for us?
5154	So no one can see what you're doing.
5155	"Marge, I'm not gonna lie to you..."
5156	"It's not fair! I've been a fan of the Who since the very beginning, when they were the Hillbilly Bugger Boys."
5157	"Well, there you go. I hope you all learned a val--"
5158	I'm looking for something loose and billowy. Something comfortable for my first day of work.
5159	"Well think again. Son, you're going to juvie."
5160	"Hey, the only thing left-wing about me is the way I write."
5161	"Well, I haven't said no to you lately, have I?"
5162	Kirk and Luann split up...
5163	"One seafood burrito, Apu."
5164	"So anyway, I says to Mabel, I says..."
5165	Then why are you wearing that vest?
5166	"Uh, it fell off a truck. You know, a truck-truck."
5167	Pfft! Facts are meaningless. You can use facts to prove anything that's even remotely true. Facts shmacts.
5168	"Thank you. I never thought I'd make it past four hundred episodes -- what with the drinking and the smoking and the fact that I'm just not that good. It seems like just yesterday that we started the show, with the original Krusketeers!"
5169	We understand perfectly well!
5170	"Ow! Bart, that's hot!"
5171	What percentage of prayers really come true?
5172	He does all the time. You just never listen.
5173	But you're going to annoy thousands of people just to make a few measly dollars. It's nothing but panhandling!
5174	Only if you clean your room.
5175	I bet you don't know this one. How'd you like a Hertz Donut?
5176	"Take it like a man, boy. And do everything your little sister says."
5177	It's not my fault -- Grampa told me to kiss her!
5178	"Son, I'll never understand women if I live to be forty."
5179	"Oh, ah, c-c-could you sleep on my side? I-I'm trying to preserve Maude's indentation."
5180	"Oh, no, I'm not... Oh, well, let's see whatcha got here."
5181	You were friends with three other boys and I became close with their moms.
5182	"Bart, this guy served two tours in middle school! Abort prank!"
5183	"That's right, Mr. Canseco."
5184	"All right, children. Let me have those letters. I'll send them to Santa's workshop at the North Pole."
5185	Hmmm. Seems a shame to chuck out these cross-country skis. I'll keep one.
5186	"Now, for your final test. To fully become a man, you must pick a fight with someone weaker than you."
5187	"And you know, Marge, those salespeople weren't really our friends."
5188	"Ah, that's gotta hoit!"
5189	"Homer, this really isn't necessary..."
5190	Yawn. I heard that when I was in the third grade. It's not scary.
5191	"Doctors Without Borders, you're now doctors without faces!"
5192	"Well this is very impressive, Lisa. I'm kicking this right onto the mantle."
5193	I secretly switched the flash drives.
5194	"Now, to save on calories, I won't eat the paper in the fortune cookie."
5195	It's hard to believe this used to be an internment camp.
5196	We're not gonna make it!
5197	But I'm up two hundred thousand dollars! Give me my money!
5198	"I can't believe it! I'm actually running a marathon! Oh, I hit the wall! This is so painful! Hey, I got my second wind. Another wall! I ju-- Woo hoo! Third wind!"
5199	Uh say... uh... Reverend... are we gonna get a chance to do any fishing?
5200	Whoa. How'd you find it?
5201	Why did this happen? Whyyyyyy?
5202	But wouldn't that make us con artists?
5203	"Look, I want a baby brother, but I can't get my parents to do it."
5204	Did you just vomit in that suit?
5205	You're not listening!
5206	Mom's almost ready for her date. She sure seems taken by this new beau. I feel so bad for Grampa.
5207	"Thank you... Thank you... Hey, hey! No, I ain't readin' that. No, not that either."
5208	"Yep, you're the crack head. What dessert are you gonna get?"
5209	"The only golf we'll watch is ladies' golf, and we're not watching that. Now in three... two... one..."
5210	Apologize for that remark.
5211	"Okay kids, we only have time for a quick visit to Grampa, so as soon as he feels loved, we're outta there."
5212	"Well, you knew I had a temper when you married me."
5213	"Gotta change Maggie! Dear God, we gotta change Maggie!"
5214	"He's gonna kill Rod and Todd, too... That's horrible. In principle."
5215	"Oh, you'll never go broke appealing to the lowest common denominator."
5216	Lenny says we've got the day off! Yippee!
5217	The alien has a sweet heavenly voice -- like Urkel! And he appears every Friday night -- like Urkel!
5218	"Hey, that's what I do in my room, 'Lis. I squeak my chair."
5219	"Now that we're all alone, Marge, admit it. You like Lisa best."
5220	"Uh, good morning, Lord. I just have to, ah, compliment you on this beautifully crafted mate."
5221	"You're completely fine! I've been taking care of you, giving you love and attention... for nothing!"
5222	"Look at Bart's homework. Back when he was your age, he was smart as a chimp."
5223	"Oh, don't look so shocked! You knew the deal!"
5224	What about Uncle Tyrone?
5225	"All right, let's see what we've got here."
5226	"I don't need your charity titters. Now, say hello to my girlfriend, Charity Titters."
5227	"Now that I'm the town's oldest man, I'm starting to realize I'm not a young man anymore. I'll have to start taking better care of myself. You know, I haven't had a medicino checkup in ages."
5228	My mom's number is on there if you want to check up on me.
5229	"Wow! Up here, that feels good!"
5230	"Beautiful, huh? Homer and I used to come up here on dates."
5231	"I am not too fat. I'm alive, aren't I?"
5232	"Do you know what I just learned? My job is the reason I get those checks every week! And now that I'm demoted, the checks have gotten smaller! Not in physical size, but--"
5233	I'm going out. I run errands during the day.
5234	"I waited and waited, but Santa never came back! If I hadn't invented a jet ski made of coconuts, I'd have never gotten home. And then when I did, the war was over and the nurses were all kissed out."
5235	"Well, Mrs. K. I have just the book slash DVD for you. ""The Answer."""
5236	"Don Rickles zinged you, Marge."
5237	"Well, we hit a little snag when the universe sorta collapsed on itself... but dad seemed cautiously optimistic."
5238	"Marge, those groves of cherry blossoms will bloom every year, to remind the world of the sweetest, most forgiving woman who ever lived... am I off the hook?"
5239	"OhmyGod! OhmyGod! OhmyGod! OhmyGod! I danced with a Gay! Marge, Lisa, promise me you won't tell anyone. Promise me!"
5240	"Hey Lis, there was a big train wreck last night. You wanna see the victims?"
5241	Ay carumba! If you guys don't get together... what does that mean for me in the future?
5242	"Right, naked Duffman?"
5243	"I wouldn't do that, Reverend. You see, ""Saint Flanders"" is as crooked as you or me!"
5244	"Oh my God, I'm late for work."
5245	And you're fine with me trying to get it published?
5246	Mrs. K.? Are you still bumping moustaches with Ned?
5247	Stupid prey. They never suspect anything.
5248	"Soon, baby, soon. Let me just kill Milhouse's character. He thinks we're on the same team."
5249	Now that's just non--
5250	I guess I'll just cut my own hair.
5251	Why does everything I forbid always happen?
5252	Thanks for introducing me.
5253	"Aw sweetie, money can't change people. It can just help them be who they are. I gave a bum a dollar once and he used it to buy an Ellery Queen mystery. But there was one mystery Ellery Queen couldn't solve: why a man was named Ellery. But my point is, whatever I said before I started talking about Ellery Queen."
5254	"Not bad for a newbie, Bart! You just may be the second-best player up here. In case you're wondering who the best one is, it's me."
5255	Mass hobo grave in cellar...
5256	My teacher's still bullying me.
5257	I thought I was the only one.
5258	"If there's one way to get the truth out, it's on a cable news channel."
5259	I thought you were dead.
5260	"Hey, your early porno movies! Are any of these hetero?"
5261	Think differently... Think differently... Think differently... Think differently...
5262	"Let me try. Will I get beat up today? ""All signs point to yes."""
5263	"Marge, get back in bed."
5264	Is that all this temporary job was to you: a gig?
5265	Huh. Two queens. That's a great start.
5266	"You mean it ain't me noggin, it's me peepers? Well that's just loverly."
5267	"Eh, he knows how I feel."
5268	"My new best friend. We think alike, we act alike, we finish each other's sandwiches..."
5269	"Homer, that was Apollo Twelve!"
5270	Will there be cavemen in heaven?
5271	What? No one judges my wife's thunderbags! Well maybe I was wrong about these people. Who ever thought a cool person could be a jerk?
5272	"You see? Before, I probably would have driven to the syrup."
5273	"Liberal whacko, eh? Any young beaux?"
5274	"Yes, of course I would. Who wouldn't like that? To be part of the Music Scene..."
5275	And you can live with that.
5276	"Well, that can be arranged."
5277	"No. We're gonna follow them across this great land, making sure they don't have one moment of fun."
5278	"Sky, sky, sky with building, grass, grass with foot."
5279	"Oh, yeah? What's my shoe size?"
5280	But she's not our dog.
5281	My baboon heart! Body... rejecting it...
5282	"Yeah, he's all ""Cowabunga, dude!"" What's that mean? Nothing, I bet."
5283	Why don't you just cook less?
5284	"Gotta change that answering machine tape! Oh God, I gotta change that tape!"
5285	Oh my God! He's getting closer!
5286	"12:80. No, wait. Wait. Wh-- what comes after twelve?"
5287	Huh? But how are we supposed to combine the DNA of two strains of the same species?
5288	That means that Springfield's presidential primary will be first in the nation! Even earlier than New Hampshire!
5289	Can I use your bathroom?
5290	They'll never believe a Simpson killed a Flanders by accident. Even I have my doubts.
5291	But it's not real happiness. It's just because of an untested drug!
5292	"Yeah, well, the joke's on you, smart guy. The garage made it to Heaven too!"
5293	"Nelson, Funny Town doesn't exist."
5294	"Please! Homer, I am so sick of this unmotivated, jealous..."
5295	"Oh yeah? Why don't I just punch you in the nose, Bud?"
5296	"Wow, there's a rainbow outside."
5297	"It's just not fair, dammit!"
5298	"Me in charge of safety? This place could blow sky-high. Nah. I'll concentrate on my work now. Gee, this guy's desk sure is big. I can't let Marge support the family. This guy's got the cleanest shirt I've ever seen. What should I..."
5299	Homer Simpson! Did you take Maggie to Moe's?
5300	"...So anyway, if you take that bottle down, and pass it around--"
5301	"No, it's nothing bad. I'm just concerned, because my husband hasn't been attending your services lately."
5302	Go to Work with Your Parents Day?
5303	That man is instantly the most annoying person I've ever met. A soy-based snack will calm me down.
5304	"Whatcha doin', Mom? Goin' crazy?"
5305	This family has had a lot of hoods put over their heads.
5306	I want a free car because I'm Krusty. Krusty the clown! Get it? Krus-ty!
5307	"Lisa, the whole reason we have elected officials is so we don't have to think all the time. Just like that rain forest scare a few years back. Our officials saw there was a problem, and they fixed it. Didn't they?"
5308	Yo ho ho and a bottle of fun!
5309	Asleep with your eyes open? Mom?
5310	"And even then, he could only speak German!"
5311	"Ooh, good idea. Bart, what are you doing for Black History Month?"
5312	"Now Homer, don't panic. You have plenty of white shirts."
5313	"Balsam Specific? While we're burning money, why don't we give her a Curative Galvanic Belt, too?"
5314	Brilliant! We lost sixty million dollars and they're cheering for more!
5315	"Could you cut it out, you two? Mommy needs some quiet right now."
5316	I melted string cheese over some corn chips!
5317	That's good enough for me.
5318	Yup. It's really boring. You kids would have hated it.
5319	I was just telling him how brave he is to worship a false god.
5320	"We've talked about this, Marge. The hammock is a chore-free zone."
5321	"Welcome to ""Cinema Pirate-diso."" Tonight's movie is ""Life is Funny,"" directed by Judd Apatow. It's based on his life, starring his family, and adlibbed by his friends. So for the next three and a half hours, enjoy!"
5322	But I'm invested in the characters.
5323	"Hey! I said that. My name is Lisa Simpson, and I made a chart of all the suspects in the Burns case. Look."
5324	"Lady, please. Get back in your overturned car. Let the guys handle this."
5325	"Mr. Burns, I don't want to seem ungrateful. But, I want to go home to my family."
5326	"Well, that's all the evidence I need. Arrest the girl!"
5327	"No, Springfield is ""America's crud-bucket."" At least according to Newsweek."
5328	Donkey Basketball? Now I've heard everything! Unlike you!
5329	How the hell do you know?
5330	"Marge, up to now I thought your hair was blue cotton candy, but now I know it's a solid loaf of brain."
5331	"I think you're right, dumplin'."
5332	It ain't over till the fat lady sings.
5333	"His drool! It's warm! He's alive! Homer, Homer, wake up, you're alive!"
5334	I've started a crusade against cartoon violence.
5335	I think what my father's saying is you're like a member of the family now.
5336	Were you like this when Mom was pregnant with me?
5337	"Lisa and Maggie are downstairs, and Bart's in his room with Milhouse."
5338	It's important I get a hold of him. I have to tell him I don't care about his money and I love him.
5339	I can't please any woman.
5340	"Well, I've placed marksmen on the roof to shoot the balloons one-by-one, but frankly, they're not very good."
5341	"I did a lot of stuff today. I went to Starbucks, but you didn't see that on tape."
5342	Bonded?! How many times?
5343	"Yes. ""Are you a good lover?"" ""Yes."" Oh, I'm doin' great!"
5344	See? Got her on the first bounce.
5345	"Don't stop achieving just yet, Lisa. You are not alone -- Flotus-one. ""Flotus-one?"" Who could that be?"
5346	"Oh God, my back! It hurts so much, and my job is so unfulfilling!"
5347	I hear those kids' voices are done by grownups.
5348	"Bad influence my ass! How many times have I told you, never listen to your mother!"
5349	"And to take out the biggest threat of all, we're pre-crashing the chandelier."
5350	Their tap water tasted better than ours!
5351	"No, discipline would imply I'm trying to make him better... so, are you married?"
5352	Should I just back out of the room?
5353	"Friday evening we performed ""Angels In America: A Gay Fantasia on National Themes."" Part one: Millennium Approaches..."
5354	"Actually, sir, the man who lived here didn't have many friends. But you're a better person than he ever was."
5355	"Hey, look what was in here. A program from that guy's funeral."
5356	All right! We eat tonight!
5357	No pink box?! Wha -- what's going on?
5358	"Oh, sure. Give me the one with all the monsters."
5359	"Gimme the bat, Marge. Gimme the bat! Gimme the bat! C'mon, gimme the bat. Gimme the bat ba-bat!"
5360	"Hey immigrants, beat it! Country's full!"
5361	"Okay, we have our choice of Rectangle Land, Cube Country or Squaresville."
5362	Although there were a few holes in the story.
5363	"Oh great, the tuck-in express in right on time."
5364	And I'll make sure Flanders doesn't bother us.
5365	I'm gonna miss the whole summer.
5366	There's nothing to worry about. Now everyone go to sleep. Good night.
5367	Well... there's a tall boy in front of me in class so I can't see the board.
5368	It's been a whole week! Why are you letting my husband die? What does that have to do with baseball?
5369	"If it's not final, who cares?"
5370	Woo hoo! You're still mine! And you thought I was a bad dad before.
5371	And I don't know who's more handsome: the bull taunter or the bull stabber.
5372	Then you're not paying close enough attention!
5373	We never had a family meeting before.
5374	Steamed Maine cabbages!
5375	"But we shared everything. Boats, girlfriends, condos. And when I finished, every one of 'em was spic and span."
5376	"I've got him cornered, boy! Bag him up!"
5377	"Oh, you want a piece of me?"
5378	"Oh, Homie, I'm so glad you're safe! Hmmm, you feel softer than before."
5379	"Uh, well, my son is here too. Let's meet him now."
5380	"FRUIT LOOPS? That's the answer to thirty-eight down: ""toucan's delight!"""
5381	"It's a real honor to be guarding your body, sir."
5382	Perhaps there's some girls in here.
5383	"Your conscience? Lisa, don't let that pushy little weenie tell you what to do."
5384	"This is so relaxing. Homie, this was a wonderful idea."
5385	"You know, I have this feeling that we forgot something..."
5386	"Hey, you should've used Fast Pass!"
5387	"People of Springfield, to quote Shakespeare, ""the quality of mercy is not strained..."""
5388	"Dad, I'm so proud of you. If you need some inspiration, here's a book of Mike Farrell's core beliefs."
5389	But we can't accept that money. It's tainted.
5390	"Ah, watch the sunrise."
5391	Do it! Do it! Kill everyone!
5392	"Hey there, Meathead. What are you watchin'?"
5393	"I tell ya, the kid's a wonder. He organized all the lawsuits against me into one class action."
5394	"No Dad, you fell asleep in front of the TV watching ""The Towering Inferno."""
5395	"Well, young people are my future."
5396	"Come on, Bob, you don't need to kill me. I'll probably kill myself pretty soon with all the stupid things I do. Oh no, I swallowed my tongue."
5397	"Listen, Mr. Hobo. You may not have laundry to wash, but I do. Now what do you want to show me?"
5398	"See you in hell, brussel sprouts."
5399	"Excellent. But uh, put a little more apple in my cheek."
5400	Wow. I can't believe we met Mr. Bean.
5401	You'll need to know fractions to make that explosion!
5402	"Turns out, he caught on pretty quick."
5403	"Well, I'd like to trust you, Homer. But you've been in jail three times."
5404	Let me just say this once: I'm good.
5405	Marge takes off in a sprint .
5406	Maggie's thing? She won't even remember that we did it!
5407	...eating a thirty-dollar cheeseburger! Which he drops in the water!
5408	"I should warn you: by using the term ""lame,"" you're violating the Americans With Disabilities Act."
5409	"Are you sure, Doctor?"
5410	"Homer, I can't believe I was thinking of letting you touch my elbow through a cloth!"
5411	I don't know. Just give me the dollar.
5412	"The whole town's laughin' at me. Even that cat out there. Bart, kill that cat!"
5413	"C'mon, boy, let's go for a walk!"
5414	Thirty-five cents? Where did that come from? Can't be mine -- must be yours.
5415	"English side ruined! Must use French instructions! ""Le grille?"" What the hell is that?!"
5416	"That horse better win, or we're taking a trip to the glue factory and he won't get to come."
5417	So you are running a day care center?
5418	"Hello, I am Montgomery Burns."
5419	"Oh, uh. Vegetarian. Can the red sauce be cow blood?"
5420	Then came the greatest thrill of my life.
5421	"Well, a little book once told me..."
5422	I'd like to believe that this time. I really would.
5423	"We found a new home! When God shuts a door, he opens a window."
5424	"So, how's the tribe comin' along? Any papooses?"
5425	"You grandson-ruining fiend! Look what your ""number one fan"" did at show and tell!"
5426	CAUSE CHRISTMAS EVE IS HERE!
5427	"I'm picking it up. ""Sala"" seems to mean jerk. And I think ""Manjula"" means some kind of spaceship."
5428	"Now, Marge, just remember, if something goes wrong at the plant, blame the guy who can't speak English. Ah, Tibor, how many times have you saved my butt ."
5429	She did the one thing I never could. Feed him.
5430	"I asked him here to cheer you up, but I didn't think you'd drop everything to go gallivanting with some, no offense, Spaniard."
5431	I want to be very clear. I'm a happily married woman. Going on ten years. The aluminum anniversary! Nothing turns leftovers into swans like aluminum!
5432	"Good evening, folks. And welcome to my final clown-cast. The word ""legend"" has many definitions..."
5433	"Your mouth is hopin' for a soapin', boy! Now stop asking silly questions and go kill your brother!"
5434	He's only your emotional uncle! I'm your real uncle!
5435	There was a domestic disturbance at your address yesterday.
5436	"And uh, where's your Dad in all this?"
5437	How do you know my name?
5438	La la la la la la la la la.
5439	"What? Uh, um, yeah. Uh, I just want to say how great it is to finally see some chicks on the bench."
5440	"Sure I can, Honey-kitten."
5441	Then I guess this means war.
5442	"Now, I know you love video games, and I asked the clerk which is the one every boy wants..."
5443	"Oh, cool. Can I get a shot now?"
5444	"I'm a father myself, sir. And sure, sometimes my kids can be obnoxious... or boring... or stinky --"
5445	"Well, how do we get to Branson?"
5446	"Okay, we'll need the town's strongest men to roll the whale back in the water."
5447	Defenseless child at three o'clock!
5448	"Geez! If it's in a book, it's gotta be true!"
5449	Don't point that thing at me. I said you're not going to the movie and I'm sticking to it.
5450	"Okay, how 'bout you televise my Bar Mitzvah? Live! Please... you people are known for taking chances on crap."
5451	All those disclaimers made me wanna do it more.
5452	But gambling is illegal.
5453	"Trying to kill Moe so we'll get his emerald. By the way, I haven't checked, but emeralds are valuable, right?"
5454	"Hey Willie, I think I'm onto something! Check this out!"
5455	"Oh, great. Now the cat knows."
5456	Are you still mad?... You are still mad. No need to say it. I'm your loving husband. I can read you like a book. I'll just have some milk.
5457	Just tell me you're sorry.
5458	Just a little higher...
5459	What the? This isn't Halloween!
5460	"Well, it was pretty exciting, but celery soup's pretty exciting too."
5461	That's just fine as long as you're not a Mormon!
5462	"So, ah, what songs did I miss?"
5463	"I wish. Son, the best way to explain this is to show you some age-inappropriate movies."
5464	Do you know where she is?
5465	"Homework? Lisa, you wasted chicken pox. Don't waste the mumps."
5466	"Well, the ape's going to stand around for three hours or so. Then we'll close with the ethnic comedy of Douggan an Dershowitz."
5467	"So, what are you two kids doin' in my neck of the woods?"
5468	I can't afford it. Maybe I should buy one of those machines.
5469	"That's better, Homer. Be brave. Bye bye, Bart. You were always my special little guy."
5470	"No, this can't be right."
5471	"Hm, only one way to be sure."
5472	I think this is a great opportunity. You could learn so much.
5473	"Nelson, what are you doing?!"
5474	"Yeah, yeah, yeah... whoa... what have we here?"
5475	"This place is so enchanting, Hugh. I love it here."
5476	"Bart, I told you, don't draw on your father's skull."
5477	Mustn't sleep. Must monitor core.
5478	"What were you thinking, sending Bart to such an awful place?"
5479	"Oh, knock it off, you perverts."
5480	But you have recruiting ads on TV. Why do you need subliminal messages?
5481	"Yes, I learned you've gotta be yourself. G'night, honey."
5482	"Saving the best for last, huh, Bart?"
5483	"Lenny, it was pretty cool of you to spend your lotto winnings on your pals..."
5484	"It's the only way I can get him to take his ""vitamins."""
5485	"YOU'RE A HERO, HOMER J. / YOU'RE AS CRAFTY AS A SKUNK / THEY'LL THANK YOU IN THE MORNING FOR STEALING FLANDERS' JUNK / HOMER JAAAAAY! / You're a double-bacon genius-burger... AND JUST A LITTLE DRUNK."
5486	"For the third time this year, yes!"
5487	"Hey, you guys are hanging on my every word. I've become the center of attention."
5488	Of how much fun I am to be around! It's always a party with Fun Dad!
5489	"Alec Baldwin, wow. That is the coolest person you've ever been fired by. What was it like at their house?"
5490	Yeah. A house in the suburbs does sound pretty nice right now.
5491	"Better man, comin' through... way-better-better, way-better-better zing!"
5492	The best thing is I can get locally-sourced monkey meat.
5493	When who should ring the doorbell but Ned Flanders.
5494	"Marge, I've been thinking. What if, instead of donating one of my old, worn-out kidneys, I gave Grampa that artificial kidney I invented?"
5495	That's exactly what I'm having! You guys totally get me.
5496	"Sorry, I already gave him a name. ""Land monster."""
5497	You're suspended without pay! Take your clacking balls and go.
5498	"Uh, why, no. Uh... Everything is just..."
5499	"Oh Homie, you're alive!"
5500	WHEN A MAN LOVES A WOMAN...
5501	"Well, maybe I am a little responsible."
5502	You've never done what I say! Ever!
5503	"All right, I'll take the couch and you can have my room."
5504	"Not if I can help it! C'mere, beams! Come on! Hey, hey, where you going? Oh, there's too many!"
5505	"Mom, the dog won't take his medicine!"
5506	"Bart's joint. Uh, twoish. Be there or be square."
5507	"You're right, you're right, you're right -- let's go."
5508	"Dad, the story of the passion is the cornerstone of the Christian faith. And although I personally follow the enlightened teachings of Lord Buddha, messing with Jesus really gets people mad -- it's like wearing a Florida State jersey to a Florida game."
5509	"Okay, boys' school -- I need a challenge!"
5510	"Oh. Seriously, everyone says your parties rock."
5511	Lisa and I want to finance a series of animated cartoons.
5512	"...and Larry and I have so much in common, Marge, way more than you and me. If I could be stranded on an island with anyone, it would definitely be Larry!"
5513	Can you believe it? And he's even tutoring a little Navajo boy.
5514	And the exhaust pipe is leaking.
5515	I got the recipe from the Utility Grade Beef Counsel.
5516	I figure it's some guy's name. Some guy named Gabbo.
5517	"Look, Dad. Barber hair."
5518	"Hey Bart, according to this magazine, in another million years, man will have an extra finger."
5519	I did that last summer. I'm not allowed back.
5520	"Uh, Homer, I'm afraid this is the part of God's perfect plan where you're murdered by robots."
5521	"First of all my hair is green, not blue. I got nothin' to work with here, nothin'."
5522	"No... That's it! Stovetop popcorn. And it sounds like my favorite brand -- Chintzy-Pop! Eddie, Lou, we're goin' to the Kwik-E-Mart."
5523	"Moe, did you see something troubling on the tarmac?"
5524	"It really says ""die""? That sounds unusually specific for a horoscope."
5525	"Apu, I'd like you to drop the charges against my wife."
5526	"I haven't had buffalo in six hours. Marge, how 'bout whipping up some buffalo sausage, huevos buffaleros, and some fresh-squeezed buffal-O.J."
5527	"Thank you, thank you everyone. And now, presenting the ninth wonder of the world, the eighth being Gomer Pyle's heavenly singing voice... I give you! -- the Loch Ness Monster!"
5528	"Great. Oh, uh... and there was something else. Something I was supposed to tiptoe around..."
5529	Oh my God! Space monsters are invading us!
5530	"Hello, police? I'd like to report a buzz-kill in progress."
5531	"Hey, women have put out just to get out of there."
5532	Hmm... This could be useful...
5533	Are you playing poker with my college fund?
5534	"Mmmm. Ugh, pesticides! Carbomate, if I'm not mistaken. Yep, Carbomate."
5535	Remembrance of things fast?
5536	"Nine months later, I gave birth to Maggie."
5537	I can't believe that was work!
5538	"I found a place that really wants to teach me, and I really want to learn."
5539	How will we get Bart to take these?
5540	Uh... I guess I'll take that one.
5541	THIS OLD CLOWN / TEE HEE HEE / HE'S AS HAPPY AS CAN BE / 'CAUSE I GOT A GIRLFRIEND UNDER THIRTY-THREE...
5542	Yes. I am the highly suggestible type.
5543	Yeah I've been starving 'em... teasing 'em... singin' off key...
5544	That settles it. No banks for me.
5545	Oh my God! I knew I shouldn't have left!
5546	"I don't know. Lisa, tonight is very important. Mommy has to alter her suit so it looks like a totally new one."
5547	"Yeah, but... okay... Oh..."
5548	"If you don't let us watch, we'll just go to a house where some more permissive parents will."
5549	Could you open the window? The cops have Daddy's prints on file.
5550	It must be a make-your-own sundae bar!
5551	I should've known something was wrong when we got this week's TV Guide.
5552	"Mrs. K., you've gotta get outta here. When was the last time you washed your hair?"
5553	Writhing Funzos / In my sack / Makes me happy / Makes me hurt my back...
5554	"Wow, it sure is slippery up here."
5555	Babies? We've got one of those. Overrated.
5556	These badges will get us into any of the independent movies playing at Sundance.
5557	"Nelson, you came to our side in our hour of need."
5558	The food is delicious.
5559	"Come on, Mom, let's go."
5560	"Bart, stop squeaking your chair!"
5561	You went to Springfield U. You hate A & M.
5562	"Oh, I shoulda punted. Turn it off! Turn it off!"
5563	Now I got it. I got it.
5564	"That's right, she's got the ""munchies"" for a ""California Cheeseburger."""
5565	There... and... there...
5566	"Oh ho, ho, that's beautiful! We could make a fortune."
5567	"Yeah? Well, your tree house looks kinda crummy, too. Kinda really crummy."
5568	STEAD OF THE STUFF WE'VE GOT...
5569	"Ah, Simpson, I hate to bother you when you're eating, but you're always eating. Will you sign an autograph for my boy?"
5570	I use it for everything! Watch me turn on the TV.
5571	Where's your costume?
5572	"All right, so what else is goin' on? Let's see... Hey! Why do they call them field trips? We never go to a field!"
5573	"Dad, I agree that Bart should be punished, but the Itchy and Scratchy movie is the defining event of our generation. How would you have liked it if someone told you that you couldn't watch the moon landing?"
5574	"But he won't, because he's too cowardly."
5575	What play? What the hell are you talking about?
5576	Instead of a stamp museum we'll be next door to a graveyard?!
5577	I have to do this for work.
5578	"You know, Bart, when I was your age, I pulled a few boners, but I think you'll find that people are pretty decent if you give them half... Oh, oh."
5579	"Now Lisa, you know that's not true."
5580	"Me too, baby. But we gotta get real."
5581	"I'm looking for a Mr. Smithers. First name, Waylon."
5582	"Groundskeeper Willie, Groundskeeper Willie's enemy Seamus..."
5583	And I locked the back door!
5584	"Fine, it was Flanders. Now since you know everything, who was Jack the Ripper?"
5585	You don't have a cousin Frank.
5586	"You like this now? What about ""Planet Jackson and the Earth Brigade?"""
5587	"If that's not Flanders, he's done his homework!"
5588	Do you understand any part of what you just said?
5589	"Happy anniversary, Marge!"
5590	"I love you, Marjorie. And I've had my share of failures, sure. And sometimes I get pretty nervous. But thanks for talking it out with me. I think I can finally get to sleep now."
5591	"Don't have a cow, Lis."
5592	Crackton? That doesn't sound right.
5593	"Look Lisa, I'm still trying to get to know you. Who's your favorite Traveling Wilbury? Is it Jeff Lynne?"
5594	"Marge, I didn't tell 'em personal stuff."
5595	"Oh hello, Charles. Be a good fellow and tell our viewers about your theory of natural selection."
5596	"Look, we got a package from the Mr. Sparkle Company in Japan!"
5597	Here's your lemonade and here's your beer.
5598	So salty... Maybe if I... add a little salt...
5599	"I always was, honey. Look. Cameron's about to sing the song I wrote for him. He's about to learn the most important lesson in the music business: don't trust people in the music business."
5600	"Hey, when do we get the check for this?"
5601	It is the '70s! Right down to the smallest detail!
5602	"Just because it's too hip for you, Smithers..."
5603	Kickin' It! A Musical Journey Through the Betty Ford Center.
5604	I think it's pretty obvious. I'm turning our garage into a tavern. The kind Moe's used to be.
5605	That's the spirit. Never give up.
5606	Marge and I played that old game before we were married.
5607	"Homer, brave young Bart. I don't know which one to hug first."
5608	"Dammit! Well, I'll still do it. You suckers, I would have paid you."
5609	"Sir, you deserve the finest doctors in the world. I'm taking you to the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota."
5610	"Don't worry, Marge. I'll find out what he's up to. Kids shouldn't have secrets."
5611	"Mmm, it goes great with the Jolly Rancher I'm sucking on!"
5612	"Well, you don't have to be sarcastic."
5613	Could we at least agree to both hate Flanders?
5614	That room has a dry erase board. They could be doing anything in there! Anything.
5615	I wish there was some other explanation for this. But there isn't. I'm a murderer! I'm a murderer!
5616	"That sounds nothing like terrible, terrible world music."
5617	"Marge, is Lisa at Camp Granada?"
5618	"Check this out. I'm hiding a bomb in this pile of corpses, so when Kearney loots their ammo, he gets a face full of ass shrapnel."
5619	"Hell yeah! I'm representin' at ""Murder 4 Life,"" know what I'm sayin'?"
5620	My little Roman Polanski!
5621	"Yeah, but it's got anti-freeze in there."
5622	"Thanks a lot, Michael. You really helped me get through this. If you ever find your marbles, come visit us."
5623	"C'mon, Lisa, join the family!"
5624	Stop remembering TV and get back to work.
5625	"Oh, that reminds me of a funny apron I saw..."
5626	"Um, I don't know how much more school I can miss."
5627	Eighty-nine percent of Americans would rather have a shoehorn than a computer.
5628	Actually... that was me.
5629	"Come to think of it, the guy that sold me this thing did say the wishes would bring grave misfortune. I thought he was just being colorful."
5630	He's eating my beauty!
5631	"Oh, you got it. Ow. Ow. Ew, blood."
5632	Really? Willie Nelson?
5633	I guess it is sorta cute...
5634	"Hey, hey, I would end all life on this planet just to get out of doing fractions."
5635	I'VE BEEN SITTIN' ON THE TOILET / ALL THE LIVE-LONG DAY...
5636	"Dammit! I never win anything! Ooh, here's something I'm good at."
5637	Is that tea... adulterated?
5638	"Oh, are you sure? We got that new propane beauty just sittin' in the back yard."
5639	See? The ladies know what I'm talkin' about.
5640	"Good morning, partner!"
5641	"Don't worry, son. If that bothers you, I'll destroy something Maggie loves."
5642	"Hey, Cora. I heard science is working on a donut that actually burns off calories. Uh, how's that goin'?"
5643	"Milhouse, I've never told anyone this kind of thing before... but I've never felt this way before. I think I have a crush..."
5644	Helms Calls for Donut Tax?!
5645	Do you guys serve snacks?
5646	Oh! What's that awful sound?
5647	It's not my fault. It's the reed.
5648	"Look, the point is, I want to help, but you don't need a well, or a chapel, or an immunization center. What you need's a little razzle dazzle. Qtoktok, are you thinking what I'm thinking?"
5649	Tracking software? You're spying on Bart!
5650	Aghhh! Don't kill me!
5651	"Ooh, maybe the blood will scare the sharks off!"
5652	But breaking your jaw has made you so sweet. Maybe we can go.
5653	I am waiting for a bus.
5654	"No, please, I'll do anything!"
5655	Delete! Delete! Delete!
5656	...so then you delivered her baby right there in the elevator.
5657	"Hey, Mom. Thanks for comin' out."
5658	"Faster, Marge! Faster! The snapping turtles are massing!"
5659	"Well, I can't argue with the man who wrote ""Profiles in Courage."""
5660	"Tough day at school, boy?"
5661	Malge! Ahmiss oo. Ahmiss oo so mug...
5662	That was your last pair! How did it happen?
5663	"Lisa Simpson, you're under arrest for the teaching of non-Biblical science!"
5664	Never again will I question...
5665	I think Godzilla's bigger than Superman.
5666	"Homer, maybe it's the Champale talking, but I think you're pretty sexy."
5667	"Well, I've never been one to break the law..."
5668	"Ah, there's nothing like a good old-fashioned picnic. How's my kite doing, Smithers?"
5669	"Maybe you're right, Lisa. Maybe you're pie. Pie-be you're pie."
5670	"Pick the red, get ahead, pick the black, set you back."
5671	"What about: being an illiterate TV clown who's still more respected than all the scientists, doctors and educators in the country put together?"
5672	"Oh, I don't need anything like that - yet. Just gimme my gun."
5673	"Well, this goes right into the old poor box."
5674	"Listen, Marge, uh, how would you feel if I told you the dog ran away?"
5675	Because you've already done it once.
5676	"Don't be scared, Dad. It's not so hard taking care of us."
5677	"Please, Homie, I know you can do this."
5678	"If you fire me, I'll call President Sarkozy and he'll be all over you like Truffaut on Hitchcock."
5679	"Now relax, Dottie. Leave everything to me."
5680	"I get food through the mail, but in a different way. Every month Good Housekeeping arrives in my mailbox bursting with recipes. Sometimes the most satisfying meal is the one you cook yourself."
5681	"That's great, Mom. But don't forget..."
5682	"Well then, I have a back-up plan. See, while the unprepared are still sitting around twiddling their thumbs and going doo-doo-doo-dee-doo-do-doo..."
5683	"Hey Grampa, top me off."
5684	Oh my God! Everyone Snake swore revenge on is being murdered!
5685	"Well, it might be fun to be a landlord. Landfella -- there's only one Lord!"
5686	Hold for the President.
5687	"To prove that this metal O is harmless I will personally eat one. See, there's nothing... Oh boy! This thing is shredding my insides!"
5688	Of course I'll accept! Bart! I've missed you so mu-- You want to speak to Lisa?
5689	"Why, Laura. What a pleasant surprise."
5690	"Flanders, Flanders, uh, uh, when should a boy start dating?"
5691	"I dunno, Mom. I think they're up to something..."
5692	"Hey, it feels a little better."
5693	"Excellent. Now, to the matter at hand. Who will we put up for young Wilcox's congressional seat?"
5694	"Hey, you beat me. What a great day we've had, huh?"
5695	Tell my young sweetheart here of our youthful exploits.
5696	LISA SIMPSON / LISA SIMPSON
5697	"Oh, this is gonna be sweet."
5698	"Look, everybody! Here they come!"
5699	"Hey, Vinnie, how's about a pizza? I got-a no job."
5700	"Now, I appreciate that, honey, but we need one hundred and fifty dollars here."
5701	"Bongo didn't forget you. Unlike those gerbils of yours we gave away years ago. Oh, they were fickle as hell."
5702	No you didn't -- your plan was to burn the corn.
5703	"Well, I rented that plane."
5704	Get your clammy paws off my money.
5705	I wanna stay here with Mr. Burns.
5706	"Listen here, Simpson. Your son has been exposing our kids to adult themes, unabashed dictionaries, and the lesser short fiction of John Cheever!"
5707	That's enough running.
5708	"Oh angel, listen not to this child of Satan."
5709	"Make way for Superman, said Superman as he punched everyone at the Coffee Bean. Chapter Two..."""
5710	Step over this line and say that. I'll kick your butt. At Nintendo.
5711	"Uh, well, he seemed like a loner... kept to himself, mostly."
5712	"Oh for gosh, can't you people solve these problems yourselves? I mean we can't be uh ""Policing"" the whole city."
5713	"One more felony assault, Simpson, and you're goin' down. I didn't know I could fit in a bubble. I must be losin' weight."
5714	"Oh, Maggie, you got oatmeal all over. Homer, would you clean her off?"
5715	Suppose someone wanted to buy it from you?
5716	I've died and come back. It's overrated.
5717	"YOUR LIPS RED AS FLAME, / YOUR FACE WITH A LUSTER / THAT PUTS GOLD TO SHAME!"
5718	"Mom, John likes ""Itchy and Scratchy"" as much as we do -- maybe more!"
5719	"So, Jenny, I hear you're religious. Know what my favorite book of the Bible is? Revelations."
5720	Mmmm... re-circulated air.
5721	Hey Mom! Wanna go for a ride?
5722	"No, Homer, being an artist was my dream. But now, without even trying, you've accomplished more in a week than I have in my whole life."
5723	It's not me! I used a stunt butt.
5724	Nelson! Um... that note Milhouse gave you... it wasn't from him. It was from... me.
5725	Brilliant! I have absolutely no idea what's going on.
5726	"Oh Bart, this is all happening so fast! Let's call my mom together!"
5727	"Sir, ah, although I do enjoy your loud, excessive honking, it doesn't seem to be moving the crowd."
5728	Where do you think you're goin'?
5729	I could listen to your twang all day.
5730	"I'm sorry, Ned. I never thought this would happen."
5731	"I'll bet you really hate Rex Banner, huh?"
5732	"Hey, you got the keys!"
5733	"Man, I was so scared."
5734	"for Nonviolence, Understanding and Helping."""
5735	"Who is that bookworm, Smithers?"
5736	"Look, I'm throwing papers."
5737	As familiar as it's proper to be.
5738	They're as addictive as they are poisonous.
5739	"Okay, nobody panic. There's plenty of spray for me."
5740	No. I think I went too far.
5741	"Ah, now for a little powder blue."
5742	"Welcome to the family, Snowball III!"
5743	It's me sir. Bobo. Hug me. Squeeze me. Tug at my fur.
5744	497... 498 words. Hmph.
5745	I AM HOMER TRIBAL CHIEF / I AM WEARING TINY BRIEFS / BRAVES TEACH VALUE BOYS SHOULD KNOW / NOW EXTENDED DRUM SO-LO
5746	But you seemed so happy in the ocean. All that playful leaping.
5747	What is it Unky Herb?
5748	I got a plastic Krusty-saurus.
5749	It sure is! There's nothing more natural than... that. It's just that Maggie's already... milked me today!
5750	"Homer, where did you get that truck?"
5751	"There's the Rich Texan -- and his daughter, Paris Texan."
5752	GUARANTEE VOID IN TENNESSEE.
5753	I told you not to pack them!
5754	That's not Grampa. Dad's just dehydrated.
5755	She sure loves that couch.
5756	"Yes, yes, yes. That's fine. Good, good."
5757	"You can't escape, Bob! If the tennis rackets don't get you, the pool skimmers will."
5758	Five hundred dollars!
5759	"Milhouse, this isn't you."
5760	"Now Lisa, it's not as bleak as that. Can you fly me over town to look for him?"
5761	"Oh, all I wanted was to make obscene profits in the last year of my life and leave it to no one. Why does God hate dreamers?"
5762	"Oh, you know how the first few weeks are: sleep deprived, walking around in a fog..."
5763	"As a young prodigy, this popular musician wowed audiences across eighteenth-century Europe..."
5764	"Ah, ""may the best man win"". The mating call of the loser."
5765	"You know, Homer, Mr. Burns holds a lot of sway at this club. If you would keep quiet about the alleged... decades of cheating, I'm sure he'd support your application for membership tonight."
5766	You're covered with a very fine fuzz.
5767	Everything in our lives is finally perfectly balanced. I hope things stay exactly like this forever.
5768	What are you trying to prove?
5769	"Glad you made it, Ned."
5770	I'll bring the car around.
5771	Marge... what if the Rapture is coming and I haven't led a good enough life? I could be... left below!
5772	"That's your hero. ""Name another dad you talked to about parenting."""
5773	Aren't you glad we got out of the house and came downtown for a little culture?
5774	I'm thinking of joining.
5775	Why did Burns make us all come here?
5776	"Daughters of Jerusalem, weep not for me but weep for yourselves."
5777	"Okay, we've got the secret vigilante handshake. Now we need code names. I'll be ""Cueball."" Skinner can be ""Eightball"", Barney will be ""Twelveball,"" and Moe, you can be ""Cueball."""
5778	"Okay, start the presses!"
5779	"Third Notice, ""Final Notice,"" ""Some Guys are Coming.""... Ooh, what's this?"
5780	"Yep. I also want to try something called ""pita bread."""
5781	Dad! The sharks must think you're a baby whale!
5782	I TOLD GRAMPA WE'D BE AWAY
5783	"I have to join the team, or I'll get an ""F"" that will haunt me for the rest of my life."
5784	"Wow! Adding machines! Industrial waste! What should we do with all this stuff, Bart?"
5785	"Well, I think we should try the Springfield Speaker's Bureau."
5786	Fine. Back. And we can't let anyone else get hurt on our property.
5787	"If you smell your farts in a dream, you die?"
5788	Knock it off! He's just a kid!
5789	"Well, what seems to be the problem, officer?"
5790	Unbelievable! We're rewarding people for acting like buffoons!
5791	How about jazz? Do you like jazz?
5792	"Ooh. Once again, my dear, you've beaten two strapping young bucks."
5793	Well... I also keep things interesting.
5794	"Homer, be careful with my sisters' heads. Their necks are brittle."
5795	"No, no, no! I don't want you to see me sitting on my butt."
5796	"Homer, I am so mad at you! I'll bet you blew up the town just to get out of cleaning the garage!"
5797	But the flood's only knee-high! At least let us watch 'til the midgets drown.
5798	"Yeah, you want a ride?"
5799	"Well, if I've learned anything, it's that you can't have too much iron ore."
5800	"Hey hey! What do ya think, folks? I hope I don't get arrested for racket-earring ."
5801	"Yes, I, too, feel renewed appreciation for the good old U.S. of A. Oppression and harassment are a small price to pay to live in the land of the free."
5802	"Please, please, please, please, please..."
5803	"When they make a movie from his books, does he get one, or two free tickets?"
5804	"The guy owns a few local businesses and everyone treats him like he's God. Well, God doesn't need his own special day!"
5805	Listen... I got a place down the hall.
5806	The experience begins!
5807	"And the best part is, my face is still on the back flap."
5808	"Oh mighty God, send a flood to destroy this wickedness."
5809	"Well, that sounds great honey, but next Sunday I'm going bowling with Barney."
5810	That's right. I got a job here so I can watch over you like a mother hen.
5811	"It's because everything you love, you love so much."
5812	"Spill it, Super-boss!"
5813	"Well, I used a rhyming dictionary, but it only gives you options. The job of the poet is to say, ""This one, I guess."""
5814	"It also taught us that New Zealand's beautiful landscapes and attractive tax credits add up to a filmmaker's paradise. For more information, visit www.nzfilmhere.nz."
5815	"Don't worry folks, we'll find your wallet."
5816	"There she is! Hey, Princess! It's me, the guy from the snap shot!"
5817	"Well, maybe a little. But I'd never break the rules."
5818	Hm. Alcohol fueled car.
5819	I thought they only paid fifty dollars a trip.
5820	I've seen the Itchy & Scratchy Movie 13 times.
5821	"Id. Along with the ego and the superego, one of three components of the psyche."
5822	"Relax, Marge. I tied up all the loose ends before we left."
5823	"Well, that answers the mystery of the missing melon, but I have one more question: did you sleep with Kirk Van Houten?"
5824	"If you need me, I'll be upstairs saying goodbye to my dreams."
5825	"Oral thermometer, my eye! Think warm thoughts, boy, 'cause this is mighty cold."
5826	What are all these recreational vehicles doing here?
5827	Lalalalalalalalalalalala.
5828	"Well, it's not my fault! Lisa, the people in this bake-off are stinkers, who pushed me and pushed me, like the pushy-wushies they are!"
5829	"Well, all the good Presidents turned us down."
5830	"Hey, Poindexter. It's Halloween, put the book away."
5831	A story suitable for children!
5832	I get a whiff of the immigrant from these newfangled superheroes.
5833	But they're playing the Purple Sox!
5834	"You know, Mr. Burns, my family and I feel that taxes are too high. Where do you stand on this highly controversial issue?"
5835	"Boy, I wouldn't mind driving that to the Holland, Michigan Tulip Festival."
5836	"Flanders, I don't care what this looks like, Bart's gonna mop the floor with your son's ugly butt."
5837	Um... the rabbits are cute.
5838	"Here, here, quick! Use my Krusty eyewash!"
5839	"Not if we buy our tickets on the internet. It's really cheap if we change planes in Phoenix, Honolulu, Sun City, and East St. Louis, spend a night in a haunted house and leave right now."
5840	Another Springfield family moves to Detroit to find a better life.
5841	"Ho, ho, ho. Merry Fish-mas!"
5842	"Oh, I'll never get a Mapple anything."
5843	"For your information, I'm his father!"
5844	"Much of the tune is plagiarized. Now go, go, go!"
5845	There was a happy young family...
5846	"Wow, well I I almost fainted, but then I didn't. What are you doing?"
5847	I don't think so. Although it would explain an awful lot.
5848	"No time, Marge. I think Mr. Burns wants me to do some long division."
5849	The kids tracked us down! Our romantic holiday just became a stinkin' family vacation.
5850	"Don't have a cow, Dad."
5851	"Well boys, looks like we've solved the case of the missing ham. Let's go."
5852	"Hi honey, how are you?"
5853	You already ate all the chocolate bars.
5854	Shaving my shoulders / I'm gettin' it all shaved off...
5855	"It is, 'cause my baby's not in it!"
5856	Nobody needs one! Now start rubbin'!
5857	"Uh, we'll stick with the coins."
5858	"Hell no! To make you my new intern. You're a real go-getter. Now go get me my dry-cleaning, which is my code word for scotch, and get me my scotch, which is my code word for my bookie. Also, go get my dry-cleaning."
5859	I don't know why we ever left in the first place.
5860	"Homie! Oooo, Homie... Hey, what happened?"
5861	"Homer, we haven't gotten a good night's sleep in weeks, the dog has eaten all its hair...And the fixtures won't stay in one place."
5862	My most cherished beliefs -- a myth?
5863	"Oh, honey. A baby couldn't have organized a big school dance. Unless it was especially skilled. Or one of those super-babies from Brazil."
5864	"...So because of your on-base percentage, Nelson, you're the new leadoff hitter. Questions?"
5865	Pretty shapes tell me to kill everybody.
5866	What did I get wrong?
5867	"Fatso Goes Nutso! And post to YouTube with the following key words ""fat,"" ""stupid,"" ""classic Simpsons,"" and, just to be safe, ""baby rides kitten rides penguin."""
5868	"No Dad, it means Bart would be a legal adult and free to move out of the house."
5869	"Oh Smithers, I would have said anything to get your stem cells. Now, welcome aboard."
5870	"Hello?... Uh-huh. Yes Mrs. Bellamy, I'll be right there."
5871	"Fractions aren't that hard, you just have to find a common denominator. For example: one half plus one third equals..."
5872	"Well, maybe you shouldn't listen to a thirty-year-old TV show that only got on the air because the network had evidence that the president ran over a guy."
5873	And Burly's still got soaking power. Spill something else.
5874	This is all my fault. I've gotta save him.
5875	"Lather, rinse, and repeat. Always repeat."
5876	"No! Don't use your real name, or Bart will know!"
5877	"Oh, how much longer can this go on?"
5878	"Aw, geez, this place used to be crawling with Russian subs. Now there's just four."
5879	Everything here is something.
5880	"You'll have to face him sometime. And when you do, I'm sure he'll be just as anxious to make up as you are."
5881	Marge Obedience Temperance Sexwon't.
5882	Hit the brakes! / Floor it! / Stop! / To the left! / Head back!
5883	He'll tire himself out soon.
5884	"Well. Thanks, guv'nor."
5885	Why do jerks think everyone wants to see their stupid name?
5886	You know what? I bet he can't even fit into his old costume.
5887	"Homie, these disguises won't fool anyone."
5888	"Um, you're just having a bad day. I had one last week. I burned the roast, my cake fell, and I ran out of butter so I had to spray the English muffins with PAM."
5889	"You killed Burnsum? Now who is gonna say ""Step right up""?"
5890	"Well, that's a world of difference. Light me up, doc!"
5891	"Oh my God, our boat is upside down!"
5892	"Well, no one has ever has questioned my professionalism. Except at my profession."
5893	"Rafting, eh? It's a perfect way to entertain them. Finally, humanity has found a use for water."
5894	"No, no, no, no, no, no... ah, perfect!"
5895	"Your father's lost a lot in his life, his hair, his mother, more games of Monopoly than any man ought... he'd go to jail and stay there 'cause he loves the easy life. But I think losing that dog was the toughest blow of all."
5896	"When I first met your father, he was loud, crude, and piggish. But I worked hard on him, and now he's a whole new person!"
5897	I'm not sure this campground is family-friendly.
5898	"That was four screams! Stupid A.F.I. Boy, never go into their Director's Training Program!"
5899	So... everyone's a pirate?
5900	"Hey, what happened to the bubbles?"
5901	"You kids have got to learn that actions have consequences! Eat fire, punks!"
5902	Sounded large when I ordered it. I can't make hide nor hair of these metric booby-traps.
5903	"It looks like a purse, that's why I bought it, but it's really a--"
5904	Then it's agreed! We ask Frank Gehry to build us a concert hall!
5905	...you promised to help me write a haiku...
5906	Bad fawn! Hmm. Shoo! Shoo!
5907	What a wonderful anniversary.
5908	Awesome. You finally made my room cool!
5909	I don't know what you're talking about. Hide the treasure!
5910	"Ohhh, because I got drunk and looked down her dress."
5911	"Wipe the blood off the windshield and get in the car, boy!"
5912	What are we gonna do with him?
5913	"Bart, you can find them by smell! That's amazing! Restaurateurs use highly-trained pigs to sniff these out."
5914	"Smithers, I'm afraid I won't be able to play tonight. My old gimpy knee has gone akimbo again, and..."
5915	How can I ever thank you?
5916	"Uh... that one's so ugly, it reminds me of my ex-wife!"
5917	Here's my address book. Go get those stars!
5918	"Hey Lis, something wrong?"
5919	"Marge, is this a pimple or a boil?"
5920	"Hey, you're that hitchhiker! What are you doing here?"
5921	"Hey, Lis. Check out my science project."
5922	"Last year, you spent five thousand dollars on donuts, two thousand on scalp massages, five hundred on body glitter--"
5923	"I'd like to order a wake-up call, please... three AM... ah, for every room except this one... that's right. Goodnight."
5924	How about some fatties?
5925	I know what the sun is.
5926	"Well, if you're not rich then how come you have a new refrigerator, an electric can opener, a milkshake machine..."
5927	"Whew! That would be quite a feat. Stacy Lovell's a total recluse -- she hasn't appeared in public in twenty years. Here, I'm writing an article on her for my next Malibu Stacy Newsletter. It contains her last known whereabouts. I'll - uh -print you out a copy."
5928	"Oooh, that is gonna hurt tomorrow."
5929	"Ah, come on. We're going back to nature."
5930	"Oh, I always wanted to be a teamster. So lazy and surly. Mind if I relax next to you?"
5931	What's that supposed to mean?
5932	"So ironic. After all my years of stock jobbing, gun running, attempted murder, successful murder, and tom peepery, they get me on a petty multi-million dollar art theft."
5933	So that was his plan all along.
5934	"Well, at least they left your underwear on. That was nice of them."
5935	"Well, Maggie weighs a lot less than... oh, I'll just go."
5936	"If my parents are lost at sea, are you gonna find them?"
5937	"Oh, son, this monkey's gonna change my life."
5938	Kung Fu Werewolf chop!
5939	"You are a picture and a half! Well -- hee hee! -- if you're finished by tomorrow, come on over and strap on the feed bag. We're gonna fire up old Propane Elaine and put the heat to the meat! Nummy nummy num!"
5940	"Well, I'm sure these things didn't destroy themselves, now did they?"
5941	Don't you people see anything wrong with what Malibu Stacy says?
5942	"Okay, have fun at the Laughter House. Now I'll just turn off my phone to save the battery."
5943	I asked for light starch on my nightcap!
5944	"Aw, who needs her? Now I'll have more time to read things I find on the ground. ""Lay-tex Con-do..."" Boy, I'd like to live in one of those."
5945	"Sweetie, we can't afford to get you a cell phone. As it is, I'm buying frozen peas on installments."
5946	"Lisa, being President is easy. You just point the army and shoot."
5947	"Uh, excuse me ""Professor Brainiac,"" but I worked in a nuclear power plant for ten years and uh, I think I know how a proton accelerator works."
5948	"Then me and my friend were about to press it, but the man said not to press it. But we pressed it anyway and we ran and we hid in the giant tire. Oh yeah, and my other friend was already there."
5949	"Bart's show. If everybody knew what a phony Bart was, he'd be off that show so fast... I've got it!"
5950	"Well, we can dress it up a bit. We can bring a fern... and a folding chair from the garage... And the most decorative thing of all: the truth."
5951	"It wasn't suppose to be this way. It was supposed to be a thing of beauty, not this abomination."
5952	"Ooh, ooh, a sticky spot!"
5953	"The phone company ran out of numbers, so they split the city into two area codes. Half the town keeps the old 636 area code and our half gets 939."
5954	"Hey, why don't you stay with us?"
5955	"It's okay, son. Who cares what a bunch of fourth graders think? You're doing what you want to do with your life. Nothing else matters."
5956	"Man, you'd think the quality would dip after fifty-five hundred shows, but..."
5957	"Dear Cosmic Wars fan, I'm glad you loved my film?! Here's a photo of your favorite new character, Jim-Jam Bonks. May the power be on your side, Randall Curtis. He ignored our criticisms!"
5958	"If you lose me, Sir, may I say what an honor it's been to..."
5959	Mm. I guess you just can't use the law to nag. Maybe I should just stop trying to change the world.
5960	Just think what that game could do for Grampa and his friends!
5961	Could you scooch over a bit?
5962	A lot of people think our Dad's behavior has screwed us up. And it has!
5963	"This is a little too spooky for me. I don't even like watching ""The Count"" on Sesame Street."
5964	"Well, they would have for Timmy. People loved that little guy. But your son, well, he kinda played us all for a bunch of saps."
5965	"So, it's gonna be like that, eh?"
5966	"Honey, can daddy rest his soda on your head?"
5967	"Smithers, I'm beginning to think that Homer Simpson was not the brilliant tactician I thought he was."
5968	Keep begging. You're just wasting precious oxygen!
5969	That's not what I meant.
5970	"He's on his best behavior, which is very impressive considering he's mad about a sports result."
5971	"What's up, Cootie Breath?"
5972	How can you follow a leader who won't even get up out of his chair?
5973	You didn't know him! Nobody knew him! But he was a great man! And I won't rest until all of Springfield knows the name of Bleeding Gums Murphy!
5974	Dad! It's Drederick Tatum. Try to get him to punch you.
5975	"Son, this was all my fault. You were just trying to make an old man happy."
5976	Oops -- the Frisbee went into the bushes. Why don't you go find it?
5977	"Dad, it's just a dumb mud puddle."
5978	So... where are all the friends?
5979	"They look like you, they were rude to Patty and Selma, and the horde has been described as ""very gassy."""
5980	"I said you could stop smiling, Lisa."
5981	That text was totally worth the fifteen cents it cost to receive it!
5982	Wow. Just think of the possibilities.
5983	I wanna go lecture the food court businesses that are still using Styrofoam!
5984	To those weirdos in the worm store.
5985	Mom! I have to tell you something about Dad! Something big!
5986	"That'll do, bug. That'll do."
5987	"Sure, they're on top of the world. Then there's a big riot scene. Then I don't know, I usually doze off."
5988	"So if you're looking for a half bag of charcoal briquettes, or an artificial Christmas tree -- trunk only, c'mon over to the Hibbert table. Pronto."
5989	"No, no, no, no! I don't deserve the pre-recorded applause of children long gone."
5990	"Not so rough, Bart. Daddy can't handle so much love right now."
5991	"...Homer's family needs him too, and that's that."
5992	"I know it seems farfetched, even insulting to your intelligence. But, there's a simple and highly satisfying explanation. You see..."
5993	"Dad, that's just a plant."
5994	Co-President? Are you crazy?
5995	"Not prostitutes, Protestants."
5996	Which phone company? There are hundreds of them. And they all keep changing their names.
5997	"Honey, everything's fine. There's nothing to worry about."
5998	We'll clean out those stupid Americans.
5999	"Okay, Mr. Teeny. Before the cops come, swallow all these illegal pills, then run to the vet."
6000	Can I use that on the chalkboard?
6001	"I'm not in good hands! I'm in no hands! Like a bad neighbor, no one is there!"
6002	"You know, I've had a lot of jobs: boxer, mascot, astronaut, imitation Krusty, baby proofer, trucker, hippy, plow driver, food critic, conceptual artist, grease salesman, carny, Mayor, grifter, bodyguard for the Mayor, country western manager, garbage commissioner, mountain climber, farmer, inventor, Smithers, Poochie, celebrity assistant, power plant worker, fortune cookie writer, beer baron, Kwik-E-Mart clerk, homophobe, and missionary. But protecting Springfield, that gives me the best feeling of all."
6003	You never had detention all summer.
6004	"A really fun party? Full of colored cheeses and awesome stuff to do? Doesn't seem like your kind of thing, Marge."
6005	"How do I win Marge over? I could get her kids to like me! No, that ship has sailed."
6006	"Well, it was a long trip, but we're almost there."
6007	I'm still mad at you for chopping up my skateboard with an axe.
6008	"Love? ""Signed photo""?! Marge hasn't asked me for a signed photo in months! Well I'll show her!"
6009	So that's why I've been smelling margaritas at three a.m.
6010	"Thanks, Julio. I love you as a blonde."
6011	"Good God, Homer! You're turning our wonderful little town into America's trash-hole."
6012	I'm getting worried about Lisa. She's been gone for hours.
6013	The Simpsons are back!
6014	"This house has quite a long and colorful history. It was built on an ancient Indian burial ground, and was the setting of satanic rituals, witch burnings, and five John Denver Christmas Specials."
6015	It's not fair. I always wanted to drive a food-shaped car.
6016	"Bart, go out to the shed and get some more butane!"
6017	"Hey Flanders, have you seen my Frisbee?"
6018	"Dad, is there anything unusual in Grampa's coffee?"
6019	"Tonight I want you to really try to sleep in your own bed, because... Homer, stop that!"
6020	"You wanna know somethin', Bart?"
6021	"Hm, wrong hands, eh? That's your cue, boys."
6022	"Man, this is pathetic. I'm goin' for it."
6023	But you did have violent diarrhea. Nobody open the hallway closet until I say it's okay.
6024	"Don't worry, Simpson, it just so happens I have a chair at Springfield University..."
6025	What's all the hubbub-aloo?
6026	"Lisa, they're gonna put a stink bomb in the school! I might be able to stop them, but I'll need a schematic of Jimbo's house."
6027	"Charity, eh? What's my cut?... Nothin'?! I make more than that taking a shvitz."
6028	Society will not have to start from square one.
6029	"With your share of the money, you could get your own studio apartment..."
6030	"Okay, that's good! Stop there!"
6031	"After all, negotiations make strange bedfellows."
6032	"Don't worry, honey. I don't even know if they serve alcohol at this thing."
6033	It seems the Federales have been tipped off by an anonymous whistle blower.
6034	Ow! Today's grass is far sharper than the grass in my day.
6035	Let's get out of here.
6036	Oh no! Now who will sell oranges on the off-ramp?
6037	What are we gonna do to that field?
6038	Not to mention this Power Point demonstration he did just last week.
6039	"Beat it, ducks! I'm not old enough to have food for you! I'm sexy! Young and sexy!"
6040	Well... what have we here? Looks like your un-cool dad scored tickets to Hullabalooza.
6041	Heh-heh. Scaredy-cat...
6042	"Well, duh! With what, Ned?"
6043	"Quit riding the brake, Otto. Give it some gas, man."
6044	"Hey Milhouse, knock him down if he's in your way! Jimbo! Jimbo! Go for the face! Look! Ralph Wiggum lost his shin guard! Hack the bone! Hack the bone!"
6045	Watching those women is giving me ideas...
6046	"Hm, we've had a lot of bills lately. Better put in some overtime."
6047	"Homer, you're supposed to be hunting for Bart!"
6048	"I'll take it from here, Fake-o."
6049	Never leave again... never leave again... never leave again.
6050	This party is so much better than the crummy ones we plan.
6051	"I won't be happy until I find out what you're up to. Wherever you go and whatever you do, I'll be there watching and waiting."
6052	TELL BART TO COME HOME!
6053	"I admit I haven't known Mom as long as you have, but I know when she's really upset. Her heart won't just wipe clean like this bathroom counter-top. It absorbs everything that touches it, like this bathroom rug."
6054	Is she having an affair?
6055	That's impossible! How did you get here first?
6056	"Nah, I don't do that anymore."
6057	"My daughter's at that Egyptian dealy right now. She wanted to take a limo, but I made her take the bus."
6058	"I get the feeling there's something you haven't told me, Homer."
6059	The old make-out place. Hey! A new weather station. I'll bash it good!
6060	Turn that hippie crap off!
6061	Shauna? What are you doing here?
6062	I've been doing the family's books for years. I take what I need.
6063	And you never bought a replacement?
6064	"Well, at least I'm making conversation."
6065	"Oh you know... 1754, the famous defeat to the French..."
6066	I hear there's a Korean barbeque place where the beef spells out the date of your death.
6067	We can't take his money.
6068	"I've been wantin' to tell you off for years, but I've never had the nerve."
6069	"Uh, yesss... but now I have to leave on a totally unrelated matter."
6070	Is Louie keeping you prisoner here?
6071	These are hobo signs. They're to tell other hobos if a place is friendly or not.
6072	"Oh, no! We came during Spring Break!"
6073	"Best hand of my life, and I can't even... Huh?"
6074	"Hop in, Bart, they're gonna let us kill one!"
6075	"Yeah, yeah, yeah. I need some dinner, stat! And the kids need some CPR lessons."
6076	STELLA! STELLLA! CAN'T YOU HEAR ME YELL-A? / YOU'RE PUTTIN' ME THROUGH HELL-A / STELLA! STELLA!
6077	"Marge is right. I'm gonna walk upstairs, take her in my arms and tell her my good health starts now."
6078	"Hey hey, kids! Krustyland has a new ride! The Eyeballs Of Death!"
6079	"Um, hello... I'm Marge Simpson... I think I've given you money a of couple times..."
6080	She never doesn't do what she's supposed to! This is major!
6081	"Heh heh heh. Here we go. Boy meets beast. Principal Skinner, allow me to introduce you to my wife's lovely and available sister, Selma."
6082	Ow. Ow. Ow. Missed me. Ow!
6083	Ow... Ow... Ow... Oww...
6084	"Bart, thank your mother for pointing that out."
6085	You didn't tell me he was a soldier.
6086	"Mom, I was elected to make this a better school."
6087	That's impossible. We've already had the best plumbers in the city look into it.
6088	"Now do you see why I'm a vegetarian, Dad?"
6089	Hey! I'm doing it! I'm doing it! I'm the greatest clown in the world!
6090	I think I'll bottle-feed that one.
6091	I brought you breakfast in bed.
6092	"No, it makes you look like a tool of government oppression."
6093	"Okay. I'm sorry, too."
6094	"Terrific. Bart, Sideshow Bob says he'll be seeing you real soon."
6095	And now there's something I've gotta tell you: I really am your father.
6096	"Well, I guess he just doesn't respect his customers."
6097	"Well, I'm just relieved that Homer's safe and you're recovered and we can all get back to normal."
6098	"...Bart was never kidnapped! Lisa, I'm very glad you brought me this. I'll see that it gets to the proper authorities."
6099	"Not the one you're thinking of, there's another one."
6100	Will I ever play baseball again?
6101	"Oh, I shoulda known. They're hazing us, to initiate us into the truckers' fraternity."
6102	"Oh Lisa, this must be a rough time for you. Do you have any friends or family you can stay with?"
6103	"Dear Lisa, you make me so happy... really, really, really happy. Sorry, he told me I needed a hundred and forty-four letters. What was my point again? Oh right. Bouvier or Simpson, I cherish you."
6104	"Dwight, use your noodle. If you surrender now, you're only looking at a few years in jail. I'll tell them you're a good guy."
6105	"Hey, Barney! Soul mate! Let me buy you a beer."
6106	"Marge, no matter what happens in the future, promise me you won't vote for Lenny."
6107	"... Somebody had to take the babysitter home. Then I noticed she was sitting on -- her -- ""sweet can""! -- so I grabbed -- her ""sweet can""! Oh, just thinking about -- her ""can""! I just wish I had her -- ""sweet, sweet, sweet, sweet can""!"
6108	"Mom, you fuss over us way too much."
6109	"I got it, I got, I got it."
6110	"I don't know, I don't know --"
6111	If only I'd seen you before I met my wife.
6112	"Great work, everyone! That's a wrap!"
6113	He's talking funny talk.
6114	"Okay, but who's gonna build your pyramids?"
6115	"Unmarried?! That's it, I'm turning 'em in."
6116	"Wait, wait, wait, wait..."
6117	You mean I have pneumonia?
6118	We're watching the TV.
6119	"Aw, I love this pedestrian mall! There's practically no traffic!"
6120	So that's it. She's been burned by the most important man in her life... her father.
6121	And that's why I didn't have time to study for my geography test.
6122	"Look there's only one reasonable way to settle this: rock, paper, scissors."
6123	"Listen, Bub. I have something to say to you, and it can't wait."
6124	"The Butter Baby Flapjack company sponsored me and a fella named McAllister. We were almost to the top, when we ran low on supplies."
6125	Teamsters are sleeping in my room.
6126	"Bart, what happened to you?"
6127	I can't believe a mattress could make that much difference...
6128	"Children, children, what day is this?"
6129	Emily-Beth? We can't afford Emily-Beth! She brings her own puppets!
6130	"Homer, those are our wedding bungees!"
6131	But they stretched out the plot and added a wildebeest... from the hood!
6132	How about a benchwarmer who's afraid of puppets?
6133	Don't struggle. You'll only sink faster.
6134	"That's right, everyone. The best math student in the whole school is a girl!"
6135	How much will it cost to build?
6136	Bob's playing all of you like saps. This man's a killer!
6137	I would embrace such a glad visit!
6138	OW! OW! OW! OWWW! / WHAT'S NEW PUSSYCAT?
6139	"Hail, brothers! Quoronon cillairia ozu mahoq!"
6140	"Oh Spade, why did you put Farley in charge of the bees? Hey buddy, down in front."
6141	"As Little Miss Springfield, it's my pleasure to welcome you to America, the Land of Opportunity."
6142	"Thank you, Plow King-a-lee-ding."
6143	Oui oui! And I have spent the last five years plotting the most exquisite revenge!
6144	Let us in. We have the chosen one!
6145	"Um, are you sure you don't want to try me again?"
6146	What kind of cheer-up talk is this?
6147	Have you seen this woman? Have you? Have you seen my wife?
6148	I said her. And I said knee.
6149	That's the angry one.
6150	"Oh, my special little guy has a sweetheart."
6151	"Marge, you were terrific."
6152	violence-in children's-program-ming.
6153	They're already up! They're sky-high!
6154	What about when we snuggle?
6155	Can't you see I'm reading a third-rate biography of Copernicus I found at the bus station?
6156	"Mom's looking good through elementary school... ninth grade, tenth grade, still ridin' the A-Train... Then suddenly, when she was a high school senior BLAM!"
6157	"But -- son, if you don't come out I can't ""hug"" you... and ""kiss you""... and make you feel all better."
6158	Roman Numerals. They never even tried to teach us that in school.
6159	"If I'm laughing at what I think I am, it's very funny. Anyway... ""As night fell, the Greek soldiers crept from the wooden horse..."""
6160	This should be in a museum.
6161	"Sir, thank you for saving us. Do you want to come in for coffee?"
6162	It's so unfair... just because he's different.
6163	"I see these kids now with ""jive"" printed on their shirts. Now, I can teach you how you're supposed to say ""jive""..."
6164	"I don't get it, Lis. You said everything would be back to normal, but Homer and Flanders are still friends."
6165	They're passes to a test screening of a new movie starring Mel Gibson!
6166	Stupid Bran Producer's Convention.
6167	No one bad-mouths my dad except me!
6168	We're not the only ones having a good time.
6169	"Yeah, it's you, honey. Please don't cry. Keep cryin', it's dynamite!"
6170	"You're right, Milhouse. Fun is fun."
6171	Stop eating the oatmeal! That's the third tub you've eaten!
6172	"Okay, but there's... Dan Quayle and Courtney Love... Tanya Harding... Al Sharpton...?"
6173	At the University of... psyche!
6174	All for Homer... All for Homer...
6175	"Bart, water will only go the other way in the Southern Hemisphere."
6176	Hello? Hello? I had to leave 'cause my French bread pizza dinged! Hello?
6177	You call that saying grace?!
6178	Rats. I almost had him eating dog food.
6179	Are you guys dangerous?
6180	No! Let's take the eagle to Shelbyville Animal Rescue. Where you took that injured hummingbird you found on the front lawn.
6181	"There it is. ""Aust-rali-a."" I'll be damned..."
6182	"Dad, you cannot wear that! That's a rastafarian hat!"
6183	Now we gotta send them a basket.
6184	"No-o-o-o-o-o-o!!! All righty, time for bed."
6185	I'm giving you your wish: to be a real boy.
6186	"Once upon a time, there was a hilarious ogre named Shrek Three. He lived in medieval times, but sometimes he'd say things from today times..."
6187	"Sorry, sometimes I forget."
6188	"He can't just eat peanuts, Dad. He needs plants to live."
6189	"Your majesty, can I go home now?"
6190	"Mom, I only hung out with you because I felt sorry for you!"
6191	Let's see now... inventions... inventions...
6192	"Ahh, not a bear in sight. The bear patrol must be working like a charm."
6193	I'd do anything to cheer up my little girl.
6194	"Bart, you're a little young to be growling at seven foot Chinese ladies."
6195	The fly's stuck in Flanders' house!
6196	How do you know I was sleeping?
6197	"Hey, Marge, what's your favorite radio station?"
6198	"Marge, I'm home! Where are you? Are you okay? I don't smell dinner!"
6199	I can't get a straight answer out of this crazy hemisphere!
6200	"Not mine. It's a sham, Bart. You get up on that big screen pretending to be a hero, but you're not. The real heroes are out there, toiling day and night on more important things."
6201	"Ohhh, I'm not very good at begging people for stuff."
6202	But I promised Marge.
6203	"A microscope at the beach -- ugh, what was I thinking?"
6204	"Hey, Bart. You wanna go play with that x-ray machine in the abandoned hospital?"
6205	"Lisa, your movie exposed our crappy side to the world. I knew you were lame, but I never imagined you were bogus."
6206	Why would I want to leave the place where my soul was saved?
6207	"Gee, I'd hate to close you down. Maybe we can reach a little, ah, ""understanding"" here..."
6208	I hope I can still have fun while everyone else is drinking.
6209	Nothing. I'm just a little edgy since your mother told me she wants to be a cop.
6210	Bart? Why are you doing that?
6211	"Oh, you think so? Well, let's see what's behind Door Number Two."
6212	It doesn't seem fair to the regular visitors.
6213	Does it look like... this?
6214	"Homie, here are the responses from the colleges you applied to."
6215	I don't think so. The U.S. Embassy has warned people not to go to downtown Springfield.
6216	At least take off your Pulitzer Prize when you say that.
6217	"Ooh, a plan fiendishly clever in its intricacies."
6218	I'd like to see your finest RV. Do you have something that's better than the Land Behemoth?
6219	You cost me a piece of all of that!
6220	You said you'd be home by seven to help with my mother's birthday!
6221	"Oh boy, this fish is dee-lish!"
6222	I'm a murdiddly-erdiler.
6223	Proctor Clarkeson -- one student still hasn't taken the test!
6224	"You know, Sideshow Bob, I believe you when you say you're innocent..."
6225	"What happened to the movies? First they got worse than TV, and now this!"
6226	Duh. She said that because she respects Alaska's privacy. Just as I have no doubt you guys will respect Lisa's privacy.
6227	"Disbelieve, as the Strong Man pulls a wagon with his bare tongue!"
6228	Can't I even finish my milk?
6229	La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la!
6230	"All right, young lady. I want you to march yourself directly to the Kwik-E-Mart and get me some chips and a beer."
6231	Now I have to face stupid reality again!... Flanders! My socks feel dirty! Gimme some water to wash 'em!
6232	Another oil well successfully capped.
6233	"No, no, no! We want plane tickets home to Springfield."
6234	But we're here to ask if you have an idea for a couch gag.
6235	"I don't think so. In fact, why don't you give me your lunch money?"
6236	I'm stuck. Why did I eat that apple segment?
6237	"Lights out, you punk kids!"
6238	"Hey, I'm as surprised as you, but I've stumbled upon the most delicious British sit-com."
6239	I did it! I'm gonna make it!
6240	"Ow! Ow! Huh, mmm, not bad. Just a hundred and twenty-seven more hours."
6241	"Guys, stop throwing things in the hole -- the more you throw in, the bigger and more dangerous it becomes!"
6242	Another thing that would be harder with four kids.
6243	I think you just sent away the first person you could've actually helped.
6244	BARBECUE SAUCE AND TEDDY BEAR'S EYE / THEY WANT A BABY GOD KNOWS WHY...
6245	"Someday I want to be an F-14 pilot like my hero, Tom. He lent me this new weapon called a Neural Disrupter."
6246	I'll have you know I could have married Sideshow Mel!
6247	"... and ""Zebra Girl,"" and ""Zillionaire,"" and ""Zoidzilla."""
6248	Here's what I do: pick the thing that Marge would hate the most...
6249	You can't change the rules in the middle of the game! We never would have had these kids if we'd thought we had to pay for 'em. Promises were made!
6250	But we had so much fun on that bike!
6251	"What the hell are you doing, Lis?"
6252	Now wait a second. You doctors have been telling us to drink eight glasses of gravy a day!
6253	"Apu has a rich life here in Springfield: a store full of great products, a lovely him-type wife, and eight super kids: Anoop, Sandeep, Nabendu, Gheet, Pria, Uma, Poonam, Sashi--"
6254	"You stupid jerks! I can't believe you could be so cruel! Especially you, Joey Kramer!"
6255	I can't believe we're gonna see the octuplets.
6256	Whoa! You're hot! Let's get some dinner after the show!
6257	But how? We would need the ultimate chill-out song.
6258	You really think we're still doing the right thing?
6259	"Marge, get away from them!"
6260	"A man who provided the Burns Corporation with forty-five years of faithful service, Mr. Jack Marley."
6261	"Well, we certainly got walloped tonight, eh fellas?"
6262	"Dad, you did it! I am so proud of you."
6263	You're a pretty girl.
6264	Your head dinged my door panel.
6265	What would you say if I told you Jebediah Springfield wasn't as great as he's cracked up to be? Look.
6266	"Solid waste, I could kiss you."
6267	"If you don't like it, it's gone."
6268	"Homie, don't do this -- you have a wife and three young children at home."
6269	I'm used to seeing people promoted ahead of me... friends... co-workers... Tibor... I never thought it'd be my own wife.
6270	Good. Now stop and dance like a happy prospector.
6271	Huh? I thought you said you didn't want a tree.
6272	"Uh, yes, yes. To the untrained eye I'm eating an orange. But to the eye that has brains, I am making a point about marriage. For you see, marriage is a lot like an orange."
6273	"I'm proud of you, Dad. Buying an electric car will help clean the air up and protect the Earth's supply... You're faking this to get the gift, aren't you?"
6274	That's my special skill?
6275	"Uh, Dad? Laddie's not coming. I gave him away."
6276	"Uh, no. sorry if it sounded like I did."
6277	Ivanhoe is the story of a Russian farmer and his tool.
6278	But they stole our lemon tree!
6279	That's just a carp swimming around your ankles.
6280	"Lisa, you are going to look so pretty."
6281	It's gotta be here somewhere.
6282	"You see, I'm trying to teach my son here about treating woman as objects."
6283	No fair! We just went to church!
6284	Here's your hot chocolate.
6285	"Let's see, I want a teargas can, a blue gun with paralyzer darts..."
6286	"Oops, gotta run. Enjoy the show."
6287	Cecil is a girl's name.
6288	It brings me great joy to unite two such loving people. Photo mouse pads for sale out back.
6289	"Wow, how does this show stay so fresh?"
6290	Eh. I'll do it anyway.
6291	All he did was try to help a young couple find their way. Does he really deserve to get strung up for that?
6292	I'm afraid that was just my pre-evil.
6293	You must be the babysitter.
6294	And now to sing you a lullaby my father sung to me:
6295	"MARGE is already taken? Oh, how about ""MARJORIE""?"
6296	I can't believe it. Everyone's celebrating their obesity!
6297	"What?! Oh, why are the oafs always the first to go?"
6298	"Oh, oh, no, it's just a little campout tonight, then off to my sister's apartment in Capital City. Hey what do think, kids? The big city!"
6299	"Careful, it's hotter than a Fox News weather skank."
6300	"Oh-ho, I'll help you. Help you die!"
6301	"But I'm so sweet and tasty. Well, time to go to work."
6302	I admit it. I didn't know when to say when. I'm sorry it happened and I just hope you didn't lose a lot of respect for me.
6303	I don't like the sound of that. Tomorrow I'm taking you to Doctor Shapiro.
6304	"Dad, you're tickling me."
6305	See you on the other side.
6306	"I was supposed to shoot you, but I didn't! I changed the future!"
6307	"I'm not asleep, I'm just resting my eye-- uh oh."
6308	That's it! I'm calling my buddies. Marge is not the only one who can have a girls' night out.
6309	I like your attitude. Take what you need.
6310	"I'm planting my own Bodhi tree. If I meditate under it, perhaps I can find inner peace."
6311	The smoke will wake us up.
6312	I'd love to! I'll be right... wait... Are you sure you're not just trying to get me to make pizza for breakfast?
6313	If I told you I'd have to kill you. Can I tell ya?
6314	"Okay! Go, boy! Go find help! Go find help, boy!"
6315	Let go of me! I'm innocent!
6316	Knock it off back there.
6317	"You have no obligation to share the money from that painting. Ooo, a support rock!"
6318	"Hey, hey, you made your sale."
6319	THAT'S HOW THEY GETCHA!
6320	"While Bart was in Hell, Homer was happily surrounded by fire and brimstone."
6321	World's worst friend.
6322	"Uh, excuse me, I have the chocolate milk."
6323	"Marge... a word, please."
6324	"Little help, please? I made a boom-boom..."
6325	There's Homer. There's Homer too. That's also Homer. That's Homer.
6326	"For God's sakes, my little girl is--"
6327	"But the big day finally came. And because I'd worked for it, all those lightbulb-warmed treats always tasted extra-good."
6328	"You could be on to something there, Doc..."
6329	Awww. I'll be right down.
6330	And the ocean'll do all of the work!
6331	...stacks of resumes in back seat...
6332	You have that on tape?!
6333	I bought it because Catherine Zeta Jones told me to. What a fool I was.
6334	"Mom, I'll admit it: I wanted to create a devastating explosion to get back my Mom."
6335	What does it look like?
6336	"Y'ello. Hey, Barney... a free movie screening? Of course I can go! I just need somebody to hold down the fort."
6337	"On your feet, you sniggering Oran-gu-tan!"
6338	No. I'm not gonna be disappointed again.
6339	I'll do it. I always end up doing it.
6340	We've got a million dollars?! Screw the toast!
6341	"I'm glad I'm not crying because I would hate for you to think that what I'm about to say is based on emotion. But you, sir, are a baboon!"
6342	"Thanks, Mr. Burns. I owe it all to walking."
6343	"Well, I sure would. It would give the boys a place to go after school."
6344	"Ah, yes. That silly championship? The only ""ship"" worth a damn is friendship. Look, here comes the friend ship, sailing your way..."
6345	Do not. That's ridiculous-- It's just-- It's that-- He's-- He's a rebel and only I can change him!
6346	"I'll have a Shirley... no, a virgin... no, make it a children's... Oh, what the heck, you only live once. Give me a..."
6347	"Okay, it's possible that someone may have started a business called ""Magic Craphole Waste Removal,"" but it wasn't me."
6348	"Uh, ""A."" And I'd like to add that proposition ""Hug Lisa For Me"" has my full support."
6349	Uh oh. Something's wrong.
6350	"Word to the wise, Quimby. Don't write checks your butt can't cash."
6351	"Hey there, neighbor! The Lord's certainly given us a beautiful day today. Huh?"
6352	"I don't think they're giving you enough information, Dad."
6353	"Tsk, tsk. The remorse of the sugar junkie."
6354	Flimsy? This gentle pat says different.
6355	"C'mon, boy. We've gotta go home. I saved big bucks on the delivery charges."
6356	Can you believe I'm a size four? Woo!
6357	"Oh, I dreamt it was the last day of school."
6358	"Come on, you know how dudes are. We don't go digging into the past. We talk about guy stuff."
6359	"Hollywood, here we come!"
6360	"Simpson, I haven't seen so many drugs in a wang since I ran a Chinese opium den!"
6361	"I said wash! And Bart, go work the deep fryer."
6362	You've got a father. He's just a dud.
6363	"Hey, Mom, would it help if ah talked lahk this, too?"
6364	"Hey, pal. Can't believe you have to work Christmas Eve."
6365	"I said ""fine."" What is it about the word ""sure"" you don't understand?"
6366	"No, Kent. We're gonna use the power of good ideas to change things for the better..."
6367	"Hey, wait... that's not a dummy!"
6368	The girl that got away. She broke my first heart.
6369	It's no use. We're perfectly matched.
6370	"Those ""freaks,"" as you call them, are some of our closest friends."
6371	"Food keeps my family happy, so I make a few practice dinners before showtime. 'Cause at six o'clock, we go live!"
6372	"Hansen's Disease. You know, like that horrible cream soda?"
6373	Fine. I'll just go eat the body of God. That's not crazy.
6374	Get her! She's doing something!
6375	"Oh! Oh! Well, all right."
6376	"Boys, I'd like your attention, please."
6377	You know you're not supposed to go in there. What is your fascination with my forbidden closet of mystery?
6378	All right. I got it. Come on. Get... off the...
6379	"Why would I go to Utah? I love booze, caffeine, and monogamy."
6380	No one was laughing. You kept it a secret!
6381	"That's very sweet, but we have a full day of hiking planned."
6382	"The pay wasn't much, but it kept me out of the war for a year."
6383	"Oh, there's the Frisbee."
6384	"Don't do it, Dad. Please don't do it."
6385	Uh... yes sir. I thought I was supposed to.
6386	"Homer, there's no reason for you to feel threatened. You'll always be the man of this house."
6387	This Things I Believe.
6388	Which clown? Chuckles? Professor Nitwit?
6389	"Hmm... stoats, stoats..."
6390	I've never been so miserable in all my life. But I can't take it out on Marge and the kids. I've got to carry the burden all by myself.
6391	"Dad, promise me you'll never wander off and make us explore your fascinating past again."
6392	We're taking down kids who read.
6393	"Yeah, go for the gold, Dad!"
6394	It was just an expression.
6395	"Oh boy, this takes me back. Two ration stamps and an artillery shell full of Oleo."
6396	Ooh. That's a good idea.
6397	"Quiet, Marge. This is my big moment."
6398	"Thank you, folks -- you've been a great audience."
6399	"Good morning, son! Oh, by the way, today's the day of the big tournament, and you'd better win!"
6400	Why is that jet flying so close to our house?
6401	"Ouch! I also like that ""Sex and the City."" None of those girls look like my wife."
6402	We can't lose. Look at the name of the dog I bet on.
6403	I just had a nightmare... that I was back with your mother!
6404	"Gloria, say you'll marry me."
6405	Who would've thought that our visit to Itchy and Scratchy Land would turn out to be our best vacation ever.
6406	"I know, but let me get you started first."
6407	"Hey, Milhouse! Oh, what's this?"
6408	"There are no other balls. Uh, just these, uh, reptile eggs! Ooh, step away, they're endangered!"
6409	"Sheep shank, bowline, clove hitch..."
6410	"Boy, that quiet engine sure makes conversation a lot easier."
6411	"Wow, these dummies look pretty good."
6412	"Did you hear that, Homer?"
6413	"You have made me feel so wonderful. Thank you, Springfield!"
6414	"Oh man, I sure wish I had a ten-speed bike."
6415	The status quo? Ay carumba!
6416	"Let's see, my family gives me love and sex. My work gives me money and sleep..."
6417	"Snap out of it, Bart. Face the facts. All those hours we spent staring at Krusty, we were staring at a crook."
6418	"Ahh, that's some nice reckless driving, Mr. B!"
6419	She doesn't know. You're the only one I've told.
6420	"Excuse me, Uh, Mr. Scalper, sir. Have I told you that I love you?"
6421	"I'm sorry, I don't really want to be here."
6422	"Heh, heh, heh. Heh, heh. Ohh, you'll find this amusing -- the suit Charlie Chaplin was buried in."
6423	"Uh-oh. You see, Lisa, Daddy's friend Moe promised to give him fifty dollars if the Dolphins won the game."
6424	No! No! No one is taking my kids from me!
6425	"Branson, Missouri. My dad says it's like Vegas if it were run by Ned Flanders."
6426	"Oh, come on. You've been gunning for queen bee ever since you buzzed into this hive. Now serve!"
6427	"Heh, heh. Why jerk my neck around like a goon when Tyranno-Vision decides what I should look at?"
6428	FAT TONY'S HORSE IS GAY!
6429	WHEN YOU GET A PENNY FROM A CHUM / DON'T JUST BUY SOME BUBBLE GUM! PUT IT IN YOUR CAP! PUT IT IN YOUR CAP! WHEN YOU FIND A NICKEL IN THE SNOW / DON'T JUST BLOW IT ON A PICTURE SHOW PUT IT IN YOUR CAP / PUT IT IN YOUR CAP...
6430	"And may I say I'm enjoying the calm waters of your deep, blue eyes?"
6431	"Okay boys, we've got a clue - the bullet they took out of Burns. Now, let's discuss the, um..."
6432	"Better let me hold these, Lis."
6433	They all look so tasty. But I think I'll eat this one right there.
6434	"Heh, heh, it does look like Al Gore."
6435	"On second thought, I'll just have a glass of milk. From that cow."
6436	It's eight cars long and always carries the same number of passengers in each car.
6437	"Well, he sure makes life a lot easier around here. You have to admit that."
6438	"Look at those delightful children, Smithers... all those healthy organs, ripe for the harvesting."
6439	Can she have a pony? And the last line in the scene?
6440	Isn't that a little clichÃ©d?
6441	"Wait, I know one place in Springfield that doesn't care about internet piracy laws."
6442	That's because I soaked him in slime!
6443	And I promise to do the things I checked off within a year.
6444	"I don't know, Bart. What if Denis Leary gets mad?"
6445	I'm calling a contractor.
6446	"This is my fault. I tried to teach Bart about town pride, but the power of my words filled him with a sort of madness."
6447	"It will never happen again. Now come on, let's walk home."
6448	"Okay, now we know you're allergic to cauliflower. But I made a special platter of vegetables that are good for you."
6449	Because one of them hung out with me for a week trying to get my character down.
6450	"You know, Marge, you make the best pork chops in the whole world."
6451	That'll take hours! On our anniversary!
6452	"Boy, let me explain the situation in terms you'll understand."
6453	"Well, okay. But you have to swear you're comin' back."
6454	They're not coming for another twenty-nine years! Did your earlobes get longer?
6455	"Well, back to square one is a major victory in this house, but why did you help me?"
6456	Mmmm... invisible cola.
6457	"Yo, chump, you back again?"
6458	Would you sign this for my wife Marge? She's a big fan and her birthday is tomorrow.
6459	Can I have my allowance early? I need to buy some carbon-offset credits so I can burn all my Angelica Button books.
6460	And now I banish you from paradise! I'm glad I never bothered to learn which one of you is which.
6461	I'm trying to set you up for laughs.
6462	"Well, actually, I just wrote it for a school assignment. Everyone else wrote to the Back Street Boys."
6463	"I can't believe it, Moe. The greatest feat of my life is already forgotten."
6464	All right! Full Conversion! Thanks guys. This really cheered me up.
6465	That's how low you can go!
6466	We're on an old-time boat!
6467	"...Then after World War II, it got kind of quiet, 'til Superman challenged F.D.R. to a race around the world. F.D.R. beat him by a furlong -- or so the comic books would have you believe. The truth lies somewhere in between, and..."
6468	"All right, back up, everybody. Oh, but not too much. You are definitely gonna want to see this!"
6469	No! You've gotta be sober for this. Gimme that!
6470	"Uh, yeah. It's a good thing you drifted by this brothel."
6471	"So, we've got to go to the Edison Museum and smash it! Then I'll be an inventor!"
6472	Unless he gets out somehow.
6473	And I can prove it...
6474	"Yeah, sure. Whatever you want. Ninety-five, ninety-six, thirteen, sixty-four, banana..."
6475	"When Milhouse left, did you notice if he was carrying a piece of paper?"
6476	"Marge, please. Old people don't need companionship. They need to be isolated and studied, so it can be determined what nutrients they have that might be extracted for our personal use."
6477	I'll never be part of the scene again!
6478	We pay eight dollars for the night and you can take two Popsicles out of the freezer.
6479	"He loves it! He calls me his ""silver belle!"""
6480	I'm never gonna get a cell phone.
6481	"Well... if I explain it to Marge that way, I'm sure she'll understand."
6482	That river led to the reservoir -- which made anyone who drank the town's tap water also go temporarily blind.
6483	"Hello, Mr. Burns, this is the kidnapper. Do you miss your son?"
6484	"Now don't worry, Homer. You're the kind of guy I could really dig. A grave for. Your indolence is inefficacious!"
6485	"You know, when you glare like that you look really beautiful."
6486	Can I turn my phone on?
6487	My tool shed! Oh Dad!
6488	"Oh come on, Marge. The only reason we don't move out of this dunghill is because of my court-ordered ankle bracelet."
6489	"Dad, am I cute as a bug's ear?"
6490	"Here's a preview. GOD SAID TO NOAH / BUILD YOURSELF AN ARK-Y ARK-Y / ANIMALS CAME ON BY ONES AND TWOSIES, TWOSIES / ELEPHANTS AND KANGAROOSIES - ROOSIES..."
6491	"Come on, Homer, Japan will be fun. You liked ""Rashomon."""
6492	I can't keep watching this dreck.
6493	And she's teleconferencing the Devil using that computer from Hell!
6494	Would you have to do extra work?
6495	"Yeah, there's a lot more mucus!"
6496	"Listen... I was thinking...if someone did a really bad thing to one teacher... and then did the same bad thing to another teacher to get the first teacher her job back, would it be okay?"
6497	Six. Seven if there's something good on.
6498	"No, I mean it. I'm really serious this time."
6499	"Extra mustard for Bart, sliced diagonally not lengthwise... Light mayo for Lisa, cut off the crust... Double bologna for Homer...."
6500	"You seemed so understanding before. What happened to ""boys will be boys""?"
6501	Marge? Why didn't you sign?
6502	"This is the kitchen I've always wanted. Ooh, a bread maker-maker!"
6503	"Yeah, well, I really didn't believe in the cause."
6504	Because I cheated on the test.
6505	"A damp sponge will take care of this weak, water-based... it's oil-based! Oil-based!"
6506	"Hey Flanders, how's business?"
6507	We've got to do something.
6508	Leave her alone! That's my only talking daughter!
6509	"Lisa, we did the best we could... What's a zebu?"
6510	"Well, okay. First of all, my real name isn't Krusty the Clown, it's Hershel Krustofsky. My father was a rabbi. His father was a rabbi. His father's father -- well, you get the idea."
6511	"Dad, this clears you completely!"
6512	"Dad, how are we supposed to spend the rest of our lives here? We're already bored."
6513	Oh right. Just leave! But kick like a Rockette!
6514	"Oh, I'm not much of a drinker."
6515	"Love?! Your Mom's gonna feel so good it'll make mere ""love"" seem like chewing tinfoil. Because today I'm getting it autographed."
6516	"Janey, I'm about ready to chuck the whole stinking alphabet."
6517	"Ah, yes, Simpson. I'll have my lunch now. A single pillow of shredded wheat, some steamed toast, and a dodo egg."
6518	"Now, the audio needs some tweaking, and there's some footage of Maggie being born that I couldn't get rid of... Anyway, enjoy."
6519	"Come on, Bart. Kiss the ticket for good luck, not that we need it. Heh-heh-heh."
6520	"I see. Well, maybe you're not ready for this book. It is more of a big girl thing."
6521	"Okay, wise guy. You get to pull out the two corpses when we're done."
6522	"Yeah, but that was before I got to know 'em. And I'm tellin' ya', the Canyonero is the Cadillac of automobiles. That's Canyonero."
6523	Our water was on fire!
6524	"Relax, Marge. If someone tries to get in here, my burglar alarm will let us know."
6525	"However? What however? What do you mean, however? However what?"
6526	Objection! Prejudicial!
6527	"Homer, what have you done?"
6528	Boxing wizards. Boxing wizards. What's she up to?
6529	"Open file, click and...invested! Hey Lisa, check out your college fund!"
6530	My God... it's over... We're free!
6531	Itchy and Scratchy seem to have lost their edge.
6532	How'd you think of such perfect things for us to do? Did Mom help you?
6533	Great. I'll go shoot myself for bringing this up.
6534	Why you little bastard...
6535	"Wait, Dad, you don't have to kill yourself."
6536	You're the worst shill I ever seen! You're a disgrace to the medicine show business!
6537	"Gentlemen, we just created a myth."
6538	"Or worse, am I right?"
6539	I didn't turn it on yet.
6540	I'll tell Professor Frink he's won. Tack fÃ¶r att ni fÃ¶rÃ¤rat vÃ¥r stad.
6541	What about Sodom and Gomorrah?
6542	"Mr. Burns, your campaign seems to have the momentum of a runaway freight train. Why are you so popular?"
6543	"Sir! Hello, Sir! Yes, you look like a man who needs help satisfying his wife!"
6544	"Yes, this trip is entirely uneventful."
6545	Get tickets. Must get tickets. Find phone. Yes!
6546	"No... no, thank you, Mr... uh... ... Brunswick."
6547	"Hey Chief, throw me your piece."
6548	"C'mon, boy. I know you're scared, but you can do this. I believe in you!"
6549	"Hey Bart, last one in the fountain's a rotten egg!"
6550	"Well here I am, right on time. I don't see Barney ""Let's-crash-the-rocket-into-the-White-House-and-kill-the-President"" Gumbel."
6551	"What do you mean ""no?"""
6552	I didn't want them to know my size.
6553	I can't see Juliet anymore?! I thought you wanted me to have a best friend.
6554	"Oh, that's okay. Bart's doing fine. You just have another beer."
6555	"Oh, we're not as well-off as you think. We give to eight different churches, just to hedge our bets. And the Leftorium's business has gone way downhill since Leftopolis moved in next door."
6556	KBBL is gonna give me something stupid!
6557	"Hey, quit it, Bart. Quit it! Hey, quit it, quit it, quit it! M-o-o-o-m!"
6558	The black hole is looking a lot bigger. Does anybody want to admit to throwing things in?
6559	How much does it pay?
6560	I wish you'd devote this much time and attention to our relationship.
6561	I've seen plays that were more exciting than this. Honest to God. Plays.
6562	"Hey, we'll worry about that after you're elected."
6563	"Actually, I guess we can do anything we want... and no one will stop us."
6564	THE CAMPTOWN LADIES SING THIS SONG...
6565	"Well, I'll make sure you never imagine anything again."
6566	"Oh c'mon guys, spread out! Arms length!"
6567	Y'see? This is the stuff Mom won't do with me.
6568	Last night was the making it up to me! The most intimate moment we shared this week was my ironing your shirts!
6569	I thought there was no crime in New York any more. Giulianiii!
6570	"Yesss, they are a clever bunch. I know, I'll squeal for you. To their parents."
6571	That is just grotesque.
6572	Wow! Just think what I could do with that plow.
6573	"A fortune teller? Oh, no you don't. This phony gypsy just wants to rip you off. See, this wart is a fake!"
6574	"Woo hoo! Beer, beer, beer!"
6575	"Homie, you got your, your elbow in..."
6576	It's the movie. It's so funny.
6577	"NOW HOMER, LISTEN, I'VE HAD ENOUGH! / IN OUR FAMILY VIDEOS, WE HAVE PLAINLY SEEN / YOU'RE A SINGING, DANCING, ENTERTAINMENT MACHINE!"
6578	"Hmm, if it works on nasty scorpions, then maybe... it'll work on nasty stains!"
6579	Drive all the way... get the wrong elf... ain't no glass... I'll show 'em -- I'll buy ten more gallons of their stupid gas!
6580	Me neither. I'm just enjoying some world-class tennis.
6581	I second that motion...
6582	That's not my mother.
6583	"Marge, you've been out there all morning."
6584	"Well, I think what you're doing for Mrs. Glick is very nice. The poor old thing doesn't have anybody."
6585	"Oh, a lot like my old boss. Ruthless. Went to Yale. Made a fortune in energy. Basically hairless."
6586	"So, what's the plan again?"
6587	"Now -- Grand Funk Railroad paved the way for Jefferson Airplane, which cleared the way for Jefferson Starship. The stage was now set for the Alan Parsons Project, which I believe was some sort of Hovercraft..."
6588	"Fifty-five! That's ridiculous! Sure, they'll save a few lives. But millions will be late!"
6589	"A poker site is now safer than an American bank. Has our nation, built on people suing because their onion rings were too hot, come to this?"
6590	You tell Bart all the time. You told him this morning.
6591	"Uh, I don't see one, sir."
6592	"Now to answer all the pop-ups. Ooh, a talking moose wants my credit card number. That's only fair."
6593	"When grownups say that, it means there is something to worry about."
6594	"Thanks for making me feel better about this place, Luke."
6595	"No, but I'm sure the good Lord will provide."
6596	Moonshine in the water? I'll be the judge of that.
6597	Oh my God... Marge needs this. It lights her way through the dark path of marriage to me.
6598	"Drop that microphone! Drop it, boy!"
6599	"Lisa, that's not at all like you."
6600	The load is on the road.
6601	You know everything about me!
6602	What about a jacket and jeans with a nice tee shirt?
6603	"Oh, your nightlight's burned out. And the only bulbs we have left are these red ones."
6604	Dad! It's the third Sunday of the month. You know what that means.
6605	"Maybe if you buckle down and get good grades, dad will give you money."
6606	"Vandalism fans, hold on to your hats!"
6607	"Marge, you deserve a wedding day that unlike our children, was planned in advance. So -- will you marry me -- in style?"
6608	Wow. Is it much different from a normal plane?
6609	"In a nuclear power plant, just how is nuclear energy turned into electricity?"
6610	"It's some kinda mafia summit! Every mob family in the country's here: the Cuomos, the Travoltas, the Lasordas, the Boy-ar-dees..."
6611	I'm Bart Simpson. I saved you from jail.
6612	"Now, don't worry. I think you'll find that these two gentlemen are as American as apple pie! Hans and Fritz, well that's just John and Frank!"
6613	"Oh yeah, I'm a wreck."
6614	"Whenever Marge puts on one of her nonviolent programs, I take a walk. I go to a bar, I down a few, and I stumble home in the mood for love."
6615	"You'll have to do better than that tonight, chump."
6616	Wow. Chocolate -- half price!
6617	"Dad, we have beer in our time!"
6618	"Oh, indeed it is. Tonight I will be continuing my courtship of Princess Wilhelmina of Prussia."
6619	"Okay, this is it. I've got one last chance to make up for the things I said to my Mom. I will avenge you!"
6620	"And Lisa, if I don't make it back, there's a letter in my locker I want you to read."
6621	Knock-kneed home renters. Can't we thin this herd with some smallpox-infected blankets?
6622	I didn't see any U.F.O.!
6623	"Bart, get out and push."
6624	This is terrible. The whole point of coming down here was for you to get some rest.
6625	"I guess my life isn't so bad. With the help of my loving family, I even published my first book...and I've finally reached a state of serenity and-- another spider!"
6626	We have to take in Mr. Brockman -- he wouldn't be in this mess if you hadn't dumped coffee on his lap.
6627	"Sir, I know what I wanna be when I grow up. A cop!"
6628	"One, two, three, tug!"
6629	Don't-really-care-just-terribly-caught-up-in-moment!
6630	"Okay, Smithers, you're free to go. And you, one question: do you know who shot Mr. Burns, cause we are really up the creek on this one. ."
6631	"Szechwan, eh? No wonder she's so spicy."
6632	I've got rocks that need washing at home.
6633	Oh yeah! And-and you always avoid the face around picture day. People appreciate that.
6634	So do your farting now.
6635	That beautiful voice! It's making my heart race!
6636	"Milhouse, have you seen Bart?"
6637	Turn it up! Turn it up!
6638	Oh. I get your angle. Every Joe Meatball and Sally Housecoat in this God-forsaken state will see me hunkering down for chow with Eddie Punchclock. The media will have a field day!
6639	"Nah, that's okay. I'm pretty sure I can struggle my way out. First I'll just reach in and pull my legs out."
6640	"Dang, I wish I could. But in August, our chain gang has to dig for tar."
6641	"All right, will you... Hey, go protest outside will ya, now!."
6642	"Which one was better: ""Livin' La Pizza Loca"" or ""Another One Bites The Crust""?"
6643	"Mmm, this must be what angels taste like!"
6644	He is alive. He's wagging his tail.
6645	"Pardon my French, but sometimes that man's a goofy-doofy."
6646	Human garbage can to the rescue!
6647	"Hey, you didn't see a warthog!"
6648	"Because I have this magical thing called a Home Equity loan. I borrow all the money I want, and the house gets stuck with the bill. Sucker."
6649	"Macbeth, act one, scene seven. Look it up!"
6650	"This computer is so great! I'm watching the latest Sofia Coppola movie at ""twenty times"" speed to make it seem like a normal movie."
6651	"Let's have a little quality time together, just you and me."
6652	Why you little...! Why you little...!
6653	"Smart bunnies, Hef. I can call you Hef, can't I?"
6654	"Homer Simpson, look what the snuggle fairy left in our DVD player."
6655	"Oh yes. I'm so proud, I feel my chest might burst. Can you edit that? I don't wanna say ""chest"" in a movie."
6656	"Awaiting your orders, Mr. Midshipman!"
6657	I'd rather be a happy shnook than a noble shlumpf.
6658	No problemo. We'll just sweep it all under the rug.
6659	"Is that so? Well, sleazy entertainment and raunchy jokes will never be as popular as sobriety and self-denial!"
6660	Yep. It's just that easy.
6661	"Bart, you know there is such a thing as being a bad winner."
6662	"Thank you, uh, Lipizzaner."
6663	I don't have to -- Ray's gonna be here any minute.
6664	"Well, I'm not gonna accomplish anything just sitting here--"
6665	How many of those have private planes?
6666	Knock it off! That's my Mom you're talkin' about.
6667	"Well, you've set me up, for laughs down the road."
6668	"Dad, you testified against her!"
6669	"Now I'd like to say one last thing to our Olympic representatives: if there was a medal for horrible audiences, you'd get the gold. Peace out."
6670	Reverend... Emergency... I... You... Simpson kids... Eedily... Baptism... Oodily... Doodily-doodily...
6671	"Well, back to the fight."
6672	Wait. Who is that young go-getter?
6673	Wait. How could you know what Herman said? You were driving away.
6674	"Then again, there's only one way to get a truly accurate reading."
6675	"Someday when I'm a grownup, maybe I'll go back and look fondly at our house."
6676	"Seems like animated shows are everywhere. Or were, last year."
6677	"Blankets, radio... Oh, a Gary Larson calendar. I don't get it. I don't get it. I don't get it. I don't get it. I--don't get it."
6678	"Oh that's Hollywood fantasy. We live in the real world, where I have something called ""prof-it par-ti-ci-pa-tion""."
6679	Settle down. I invited you guys here to help me with this report. Any ideas?
6680	A gang! That's the answer.
6681	"I'll krump with you, sweetie pie."
6682	MIGHT I ADD -- NO FAT CHICKS.
6683	"Maggie, time to go to the..."
6684	Forget it! Forget it! The gig's off! I ain't gonna play Sun City!
6685	"That's my dorky little brother, Bart --tholomew."
6686	"Most of the money went to convincing them that I was ""alive."""
6687	Somebody must have voted.
6688	"In addition to working in your normal capacity at the plant, you will also serve as my personal hit man."
6689	Are you sure you wanna do this so fast?
6690	Mmm-hmm... I think I'll go to bed now.
6691	The hospital? Y'ello... Oh my God!
6692	"Ooh, look! Pine-cone first ladies!"
6693	What the hell was that?!
6694	"Moe, you shipped yourself here?"
6695	Is that something your terrorist masters told you to tell me?
6696	"Good for you, Homie. You know, a lot of things happened around here while you were gone."
6697	"I would've been a winner, instead of some idiot spending his Saturday night staring into a bowl of sauce. Why did fate do this to me?"
6698	"Give it up, dad. Piggy ain't comin' back."
6699	"All right. Now, there can only be one Krusty in each territory, so I hope this works out. Tell me where you're from."
6700	They're going into Multi-Purpose Room B!
6701	I'm gonna go claim some valuables at the Lost and Found.
6702	But Bunkerball is keeping us sane!
6703	"That coyote said my soul mate would understand me, but Marge doesn't understand me at all. Maybe we're not kindred spirits. We don't have anything in common..."
6704	One more thing: Merry Christmas.
6705	You didn't validate my parking.
6706	"All right, all right. If Santa's Little Helper studies real hard and passes his finals and becomes a perfect dog, can we keep him then?"
6707	Really? I never knew that.
6708	Do what the kid says.
6709	"Look at those looters breaking windows, setting fires... They're living my dream, and you won't let me join them. Please can I throw one little..."
6710	"Okay, we've seen a lion. Can we go now?"
6711	"That wasn't part of our deal, Blackheart! That wasn't PAAAAART!!"
6712	"...Adirondack cider can be yellow if they're using late-season apples. And, of course, in Canada the whole thing's flip-flopped..."
6713	"Sorry, the position has been filled."
6714	"Well, you do look pretty in the moonlight."
6715	I did it. I found our dog. Now our Christmas is complete.
6716	"Hold the phone, Smithers... I like your attitude. Feisty yet spineless."
6717	You laugh now but you won't be laughing soon.
6718	There's one right now.
6719	"You all know I'm a big fan of American meat. Although, sometimes you've gotta cut off some of the gristle."
6720	"Tell me where you are now, you bastard!"
6721	"Why the crescendo, my dear old friend-o?"
6722	"Lis, I've learned a valuable lesson here: the pen is mightier than the flaming bag of poop."
6723	This is the most thoughtful thing anybody ever --
6724	"Well, what about people of the opposite sex who want to get married?"
6725	"And the dog in the Coppertone ad? Same deal, Dad?"
6726	"Yeah, but I'll go home, weigh myself, and I'll have gained six pounds. What's that about?"
6727	"Grampa, that's so romantic! We gotta go to England!"
6728	You're right. That suit gizmo could be worth billions. And I'm gonna get a piece of the action!
6729	Isn't that skirt a little north of the knee.
6730	"There. If I can just get through this many days without seeing her, she should be completely out of my system. Okay, day one."
6731	"I started making some calls last night, and before I knew it, practically all of Springfield was offering to help."
6732	A pillowcase full of quarters?! Where did you get that money and what have you done with the pillows?!
6733	I don't see many more movie roles for a girl like you! Not unless George Lucas needs another death star!
6734	"Gee, your station has a lot of problems."
6735	"Dear kids, I hope this letter finds you well. We are doing great. Your father is in the best shape he's been since...well, ever."
6736	"Your bees died days ago. These are their angry, mutant descendants. And they're tough enough to live in any environment."
6737	"Ahhh, the new Packard we've been hearing so much about."
6738	And I'm Jared from the Subway ads. I'm only a little overweight and sexually ambiguous.
6739	"Oh. All right, um, I'll tell you something that happened to me last week. I was walking home from school..."
6740	"Well boys, Daddy's back on the beam, thanks to Christian prayer and Doctor Sheldon Lowenstein!"
6741	"Okay I've been studying Frink's robot, and I've discovered he has one small weak spot."
6742	"Oh, don't listen to my husband. He's just an idiot. Now, I'm a veterinarian and I need to keep lots of sick animals in my house. Is that permitted?"
6743	Even the fire doesn't want them.
6744	And tell your friends it was great! Buy the stuff they advertise in the commercials before it.
6745	Milhouse? Is that you?
6746	When are Mom and Dad coming back?
6747	You're right. We have to do something. Let's watch TV!
6748	My place? What would the neighbors think?
6749	"Oh, no, no. Homer is my... ball's name. I'm Marge."
6750	"Marge, it's not what you think!"
6751	I never stopped telling you.
6752	"No, my ears are really burning. I wanted to see inside, so I lit a Q-tip."
6753	"Every since you started therapy all you can do is talk about yourself. Well what about me, Marge?"
6754	"I can't believe my little boy is already going on his first date. SUNRISE, SUNSET / SUNRISE, SUNSET / CAT'S IN THE CRADLE AND THE SILVER SPOON / YES, WE HAVE NO BANANAS!"
6755	"Well, I got my laugh. I'm outta here."
6756	"Wow, I can't believe we're going to Disneyland! Hey, where's all your luggage?"
6757	Just buy me the friggin' toy.
6758	"I see. You were mad enough to leave our house, but not mad enough to leave our property? That's my half-assed Dad!"
6759	Stupid president. Why couldn't he just stay in his own state?
6760	"G'night... Thanks for coming... We'll see you... Ba-bye... Well, I think that went pretty well."
6761	"Well, maybe I could. But every time I look at you, I see the same adorable boy I fell in love with."
6762	"Lisa, do you have a question you would like to ask your Uncle Montgomery?"
6763	"Wow, sweetheart. Look at all this seized booty. We could find the drug boat of our dreams!"
6764	It's about time Mr. Burns found a woman. I can't stand to see a man single.
6765	"Bart, how can you laugh at that? You just had a heart attack!"
6766	"It's called ""El Chemistri"" and they use science to make the food!"
6767	"I cheat on my diet but nobody knows 'cause the damage is on the inside and the first warning sign is sudden death. So, honey, what do you say?"
6768	"My brother is about to meet fear, and as usual, he won't pass."
6769	"Gr-aargh! Oh my God, this man is my exact double. That dog has a puffy tail!"
6770	Sure it is. Look at the cover.
6771	"Go home, boy! Go... home!"
6772	"More Oxycontin Candy, sweetie?"
6773	"It's bad news, isn't it? I should never get my hopes up. Nothing ever works out for us."
6774	"I, Lisa Simpson, am hereby giving away all my ill-gotten Malibu Stacey accessories!"
6775	And what happens when a child grows up with insanely violent role models like these?
6776	"Oh, our little girl's got her own cheering section!"
6777	You used to be nicer!
6778	Today's our draft! I've got to pick a good fantasy team! When I lost last year they made me do something so humiliating...
6779	My wife and kids stood by me. On the way home I realized how little that helped.
6780	That guy has gotta go.
6781	"Oh, all right, let me talk to them. Put me on with the lead boy."
6782	"Anyway, Hugh, there's more to my life than just a wrecking ball. I also crush cars into cubes. And on the side, I promote local tough man contests. Basically I'm gettin' out all my aggression 'til I go to law school."
6783	"Oh, I admit it! It's only two-alarm -- two-and-a-half tops! I just wanted to be a big man in front of the kids."
6784	"Yeah, that's exactly why I'm here."
6785	Why don't you let us watch TV and get her a Roofi CD?
6786	"Bite me now, Edmund -- and we'll both be vampires!"
6787	Is there someone in there?
6788	The first rule of bus safety is always wear your seat belt.
6789	"Good, 'cause I need directions."
6790	"First, why don't you and I and the cake take a shower?"
6791	"Wow. You must love this country more than I love a cold beer on a hot Christmas morning. Darn it, Apu, I'm not gonna let them kick you out!"
6792	"Ankle? ""Foccacia""? What are you talking about?"
6793	"Hm. An essay contest. ""Children under twelve""... ""Three hundred words""... ""Fiercely pro-American."" Sounds interesting."
6794	Is that a pentagram? Lis! You've finally come over to the dark side.
6795	I've gone from lookie-loo to talkie-too.
6796	"But how can you afford something like this, Ned? I get your mail once in a while... you make only twenty-seven dollars a week more than I do."
6797	"Pass the peas, please."
6798	"I don't hate you, I'm proud of you. You came through for your daughter when she needed you the most."
6799	Yeah I was on today. Scary on.
6800	"I met the new principal, Mr. Baumgartner. He seemed really cool. When he walked through the gym, he shot a basket!"
6801	"Well, Bart's being his usual jerky self... but Mom, I'm really excited about this new flag design. Oh, and the hotel gives you a free USA Today outside your room... No, I'm sure it's free... Okay, I won't touch it."
6802	Prove it. Using examples from this room.
6803	Ah! Dad! Doesn't this car have seat belts?
6804	"Well, let's see what else is in the job jar."
6805	"Thank you, you've been very helpful."
6806	"He spanked you? You, Bart Simpson?"
6807	"Oh, right. You guys know about giraffes, long legs, big neck."
6808	Whose turn is it to cry?
6809	"Hey, I'm flexible! You don't have to pay all at once. I'll be here all night if you change your mind."
6810	I'll fix you something.
6811	No. Any word from Karl Rove?
6812	"Oh, heck, no! You relive long lost-summers, kiss girls from high school -- it's like one of those TV shows where they show a buncha clips from old episodes."
6813	Marge Simpson is gonna say NO!
6814	Does this mean you still want to be friends? Even though I tried to cover up my nerdish... leanings?
6815	"Young man, I look at you and I see myself."
6816	"Sorry, but you need a good night's rest."
6817	Reading about this Edison character. They won't let me in the big people library downtown. There was some unpleasantness. I can never go back.
6818	That better be wardrobe and it better be good news. Hello?
6819	"This one doesn't sound roadkill-y. And, it comes with a story. ""Many years ago, my daughter, Eliza, brought a runaway slave, Virgil, to the house..."""
6820	"Well, he did vow revenge. But I can't see him doing something illegal -- he's in show business! He's a celebrit--"
6821	"Look, man. I have to keep my dark past hidden. There's someone new in my life now."
6822	Hey schmuck: puns are lazy writing!
6823	But the atmosphere there was so stimulating. It was a bustling marketplace of ideas.
6824	No electricity. Electricity only in freeze tag.
6825	"Oh, no! I'm not down, I'm -- get up, you! Get up! Come on!"
6826	I've bonded with him!
6827	Why do clown things always happen to clowns?
6828	"I'll do it myself. When we do things together, they always turn out badly -- for me!"
6829	"Yeah. Hey, Homer, I thought you were only gonna do this day care thing till your knee was better."
6830	"Hey, Lis, Mom said you had the toenail clippers and-- Whoa, Lisa! Look out! Nelson's in our house!"
6831	"Stop it, stop it, stop it! Stop it!"
6832	"There he is! It-- Oh wait, you said brown hair, right?"
6833	"All right, I admit it. I miss the phonies -- but that's all I miss. That and the Shirley Jones/Marty Engles New Years Eve Party."
6834	No. It's a House of Ill Fame... a House of Loose Ethics...
6835	"All right, Econo-Save, you just made the list."
6836	"Well, okay. For you I'll be as dull as Dilbert."
6837	I mean... you know... Mr. Burns... is so... old...
6838	You're getting a husband! And you are going to that party!
6839	"Oh, man. That would be so awesome!"
6840	"No, booze. First the easy part: kids, get some liquor."
6841	"Well, the combination of me leaving arts camp and you driving on and off the shoulder has made me a little ill."
6842	All those crooks were fakes! Set up by me.
6843	Now I really should be getting back to my family.
6844	"Death, Death, we miss you so much. You were a busboy in the restaurant of life, clearing away the oldies and the sickies and the chokies. And you made NASCAR racing exciting."
6845	It's the baby whales' dad!
6846	"No! No, I've got a lot more mothering left in me!"
6847	"I never thought I would say this, but I think we have to move."
6848	"I didn't raise him to be a quitter, Marge. It must have been you. You've quit every job you've ever had: cop, pretzel vendor, church counselor, professional gambler..."
6849	"No, last week they became Vertiqual."
6850	"Careful, now. Nobody likes a showoff."
6851	"Krusty, do you think about your father a lot?"
6852	Punch that orderly who takes sips out of my juice.
6853	"Oh, how embarrassing. Well, let me just give you one of my many other valid..."
6854	"Well, it's not like I never saw a dog before."
6855	"Lisa, you've got to be more careful! I need you to teach me all about the world of juzz."
6856	And don't you come back without it! You hear me?! Hurry up!
6857	"Okay, have fun dying alone."
6858	I wish I could retire.
6859	"Uh-um... What do you think ""some"" is?"
6860	I only gave him four cents for that nickel! Monty Burns wins a--
6861	"You are the true Dauphin. You had this impostor try to fool me, to see if I was truly sent by God."
6862	"No, Skinner said I had a clean slate. So right now, I'm as good as any other kid."
6863	"Oh man, this is great. The most evil man in town is in our power. He will do my bidding... at that fantasy football auction. And anything else my limited imagination can come up with."
6864	"Bart, if you sit here, I'll be the boy who sat next to the boy who ate the frog. And I'm already the boy who shared a comb with a boy who threw up on the boy who wet his pants at the winter carnival. P.S. I would've given you the money."
6865	"Oh, thank you Bart, thank you Lisa, for all your help!"
6866	"Good idea. Milhouse, you and me will be Omega Team. Todd, you and Data are Team Strike Force. Nelson, that leaves you and Martin."
6867	I'm kinda worried about the future. How do you deal with it?
6868	I wonder why Bart and Lisa are so late getting home from school?
6869	"Hey, the TV man is talking about us!"
6870	"Dad, how would you like to be sold to an ivory dealer?"
6871	I'll show you mad in the morning.
6872	It's going into that building.
6873	"Uh, well, I drew it on... See..."
6874	"Now, this is going to take all my skill."
6875	"Ow! I told you, no one can climb a rope. It's physically impossible!"
6876	Melvis? Where's Mary?
6877	This one whistled at me!
6878	Can we go to Duff Gardens this weekend?
6879	"Dearest Marge, though my body cannot move, my heart still beats and my brain still brains."
6880	Look at all these monstrosities.
6881	Fellow Springfielders. I have called you all here so we can enter the Duff Book of World Records.
6882	"Nooo! Bart, don't you ever do that again. Understand?"
6883	Homie... Put down your magazine for a minute...
6884	"Hmmm. Crude, but I like it. What do you say we freshen up our little drinkie poos?"
6885	"Oh, we'll see about that."
6886	Just a few feet more...
6887	"Barney, you stole my idea!"
6888	"Son, I know it hurts. I still remember my first lifetime banning..."
6889	"Also, we want to thank the whole town for their generosity."
6890	"Sweetie, you seem so blue. Did the last of something die?"
6891	"Well kids, there it is, Capital City."
6892	That's Moe and a bag of garbage.
6893	Will this be on the test?
6894	"Whew, well, at least I got a hunk of Moe's hair."
6895	"Alone! I'm alone! I'm a lonely, insignificant speck on a has-been planet orbited by a cold, indifferent sun!"
6896	And you contributed to our culture!
6897	Stop it! You'll jam the machine!
6898	ZhÃ¨ shÃ¬ nide yÃ¡njing.
6899	We're going to have another baby.
6900	"Second class? What about Social Security, bus discounts, Medic-Alert jewelry, Gold Bond powder, pants all the way up to your armpits, and all those other senior perks? Oh, if you ask me, old folks have it pretty sweet."
6901	"If we had Artie's money, I could get that snoring surgery. Plus at least two of those other surgeries I desperately need."
6902	"Peter, Andrew, James the Greater, James the Lesser, John, Philip, Thaddeus!"
6903	"Whatcha diddily doin', neighbor?"
6904	"Oh, come on! That millionaire playboy? He's too busy socializing at cocktail parties and managing the affairs of the Wayne foundation."
6905	I'm sorry. I guess watching me isn't any more exciting than being me.
6906	That's the last time I trust the strangest people on earth.
6907	"MMMaybe... but you don't know Lisa. I mean she's so smart, they hooked her up to a big computer to try to teach it some things, but she had so much knowledge it overloaded and then it got really hot and caught on fire."
6908	We can all burn evidence in it.
6909	"Hey, wait a minute. These animals are stuffed."
6910	"Well look at this, you dragged me back to my old neighborhood. And it hasn't changed a bit."
6911	"Dad, it's a documentary on the homeless."
6912	"Well those are my ideas! You people don't think, you regurgitate. That's why I promoted someone who's in touch with the workers. You!"
6913	The guy who took your job.
6914	That's because she can't talk.
6915	"Wha? Golf course? Did I dream that whole thing? Maybe the desert was just this sand trap... Oh, and I bet that crazy pyramid was just the Pro Shop!"
6916	"We were earning millions, but we were always strapped for cash."
6917	Dear God. What have I done?
6918	"Lisa, don't confuse your brother like that. Have a nice day at school, Bart."
6919	"Homer, you're... um... on the towel rack."
6920	"Uh, I am! I'm strongly opposed to... Proposition, uh, 3-0-5..."
6921	"Disemboweler 4, the game where condemned criminals dig at each other with rusty hooks."
6922	"No deal, McCutcheon. That moon money is mine!"
6923	"Well, time to get to work."
6924	Would you like to join us?
6925	"Oh gentlemen, there is no need to head home so soon."
6926	I know. My new thing is to ignore you.
6927	Yeah? Why would they believe you?
6928	...and Doc...tor Hibbert.
6929	"Ladies, grab your pebbles!"
6930	The house is slightly askew! To the panic room!
6931	And get me a bottle of bourbon!
6932	"This is my offer. I think you'll find it's most unfair, but those are the breaks."
6933	Stupid city! What the hell is this thing?
6934	"Excellent question. Yes, I am proud to be America's first straight female President. Helen?"
6935	"Eat butt, skyboy-ninety-four! I'm sorry, Marge. Where are my manners? Did you want to taunt my kill also? Press the X button."
6936	"Let's see... Milhouse would be happy again if he had family to take care of him. Family, family..."
6937	"What are you kids laughing at? And if you say Jimmy Fallon, I'll know you're lying."
6938	"Come on, come to life! I swear I'll be cool about it."
6939	Hand over all your money in a paper bag.
6940	"Hey, Dad. ""Do you hear voices?"""
6941	"Stop right there, Doc. This school has sent me to more therapists than you've had bad dates. I've looked at the ink blots, I've played with the puppets, the whole racket's a hat fulla crap."
6942	"OKAY, KIDS SHOW OFF YOUR PIPES..."
6943	"The can is in two halves, and they slide apart."
6944	"Welcome back to the family, boy."
6945	"First girls ruined ""Sex And The City,"" now this!"
6946	That's it. We have to get them back to school.
6947	Looks like this is one time the Indians didn't win.
6948	I didn't know you were left-handed.
6949	"Hey, hey, it's Jon Stewart! Everyone's favorite political funnyman!"
6950	"Oh, a jigsaw puzzle..."
6951	Being despised was no way to live.
6952	Mom! Dad! Bart's on the move!
6953	"Ooh, it must be Bloomsday!"
6954	"These Krusty brand balloons are three bucks each, but get a cheap one and what happens? It goes off, takes out the eyeballs of every kid in the room. What's that gonna cost yA? Hey Bill, what did that cost us?"
6955	Well that professor did teach me one good lesson -- Homie is where my heart is.
6956	"Don't worry, Moe. When Marge is asleep, I'll sneak back."
6957	"You mean, like, medical testing?"
6958	"Dad, Aunt Selma's treating a mob boss like an ordinary taxpayer."
6959	Huh. Might as well clean this while I'm killing myself.
6960	"Actually, I was thinking we could cut down on your beer."
6961	"Sorry, Bart, your dad kinda blew the fantasy. I only like it when I'm pretend scared."
6962	"Alcoholics, the unemployable, angry loners..."
6963	"BECAUSE HE WAS SINGING, WE OVERHEARD HIS PLAN / AND COULD SAVE THOSE DOGS FROM THAT MEAN OLD MAN."
6964	"So, anyway, can I, Mom? Can I take the job?"
6965	"You spoke while you were jinxed so I get to punch you in the arm. Sorry, it's the law. Heh, heh."
6966	Mrs. Marge Simpson. I'm here to teach an art class.
6967	Here we are kids -- the zoo.
6968	Too sad to walk! Too sad and fun to walk...
6969	"That freeloading fatso! Marge, could you cut back on your makeup budget?"
6970	"Well, if you must... see if you can find out where my dolls are."
6971	"Fat Tony, is that you? Fat Tony?"
6972	"Okay, get ready to laugh!"
6973	"I wrote a poem for you this afternoon, Homer. It's called, ""To A Husband."""
6974	Pretty ironic -- a cross being used to kill someone.
6975	"Hey Bart, I think they're finally hauling your dad away."
6976	"All right, all right, you win for now, but some day you'll rust."
6977	"Well, now I've heard everything."
6978	"Hiya, Flanders! Oooh... dinner! May I join you?"
6979	"Thanks, I'd like that."
6980	"Ooh, Captain of the Football Team! He's a dreamboat! Don't wait up, Marge."
6981	That's what we've been trying to tell you!
6982	"Zork? What is ""zork""?"
6983	"Oh yeah? We'll show 'em. Come on, kids, pretend we've got new cross-country skis."
6984	"It's, uh, seizing up, sir."
6985	"Well, Ak, it's because God is powerful, but also insecure, like Barbra Streisand, before James Brolin. Oh, he's been a rock."
6986	"You were right, Marge. These people are not for us."
6987	Those bullies are gone now!
6988	Wooooo! 'Topes ruuuule!
6989	"Your Honor, I'd like that last remark stricken from the record."
6990	Don't worry. We'll just hang out in front of the house beside these garbage cans. The time will just fly by.
6991	If Homer can join with me.
6992	"Yes, we're among the lostest."
6993	He thought that trip to the guillotine factory was just for fun. But it was the perfect place to shoot him.
6994	"When we landed, I was gonna denounce my sister as a witch."
6995	"I didn't know you played the guitar, Otto-man!"
6996	"This is either about me, or steroids."
6997	I already have my part: man who buys ticket but doesn't show up.
6998	Cool. You guys got a good buffet up here?
6999	Ahhhhh! Sideshow Bob!
7000	Who the Hell are you?
7001	"Oh-oh-oh oh, thank God you woke up!"
7002	Absolutely. Now how 'bout givin' an old man one last dance?
7003	"I'm proud of you, Mom. You're like Christopher Columbus -- you discovered something millions of people knew about before you."
7004	"Uh, yeahhh! Thanks, Mom."
7005	"Slowly, slowly -- the RV dealer is across town under that gorilla blimp."
7006	"Homer, bring that back in the house."
7007	Hmf. Why don't you want to go out there?
7008	"Oh, all right, we'll go."
7009	ONE IS THE LONELIEST NUMBER THAT YOU'LL EVER DO...
7010	What about the sleaze and the depravity?!
7011	"Krusty, the acoustics in here are..."
7012	"Well, most of it. I did wear a dress for a period in the forties. Oh, they had designers then..."
7013	From the unknown toaster.
7014	"So guys, before we hit Skinner's, I want to make a quick stop."
7015	I DIDN'T DO IT / I DIDN'T DO IT.
7016	"That's my boy. Nyah-nyah, nyah, nyah-nyah-nyah!"
7017	"Well, I don't see how me signing Homer's name is any different from you using Sgt. Skinner's name."
7018	Bart Simpson! I'm glad your father isn't here to see this!
7019	"Nice use of the lingo, Homer."
7020	"C'mon, Homer. How long does it take to go to the bathroom?"
7021	It went down in one place and up in another. We need somewhere else to dispose of this plutonium.
7022	"C'mon, give us some candy. Don't pretend you're not home!"
7023	"Smithers, I want my tea!"
7024	Let's just say I'm planning a little surprise for the execution. This cannon is going to be full when I go off. Ka-boom!
7025	Hold it! What's your clearance?
7026	"I didn't think, I just acted."
7027	My coat of arms is a Spider-man couchant on a field vert.
7028	"Finally, a character I can relate to. I bet good things happen to him."
7029	"Oh God, it's baby blood!"
7030	What did I say? What's going on?
7031	"Only in forty-eight states. Besides, it's a victimless crime. The only victim is Moe, heh, heh, heh. And it's brought Lisa and me together."
7032	Saxophone! He was a jazz musician.
7033	Perfectly level flying is the supreme challenge of the scale-model pilot.
7034	"Well, basically I just copied the plant we have now..."
7035	"Homie... I think you're taking a little too much credit for my work. I mean, look at your t-shirt!"
7036	Oh no! Call my allergist!
7037	Welcome to my homepage. Why don't you visit more often?
7038	Sounds like fun. Can I play?
7039	"I remember why I left this group seven years ago, and it's why I'm leaving now! Good day, ladies."
7040	Where every child was free to follow their dream. Because nothing is... Maggie! Get away from there!
7041	"Dad, you shouldn't say the dog's dead when he's not."
7042	No one's doing any bumping. Time to ram-a-lam these ding dongs.
7043	"I'll tell your dad everything in the morning when we have the money. But until then, I appreciate you keeping this very grown-up secret."
7044	"Cool, I found a trapdoor that leads to an underground city. Here I go!"
7045	What the hell was that?
7046	"Oh dear, now everyone will think Homer and I did it. The real killer is the man with the braces."
7047	"Lisa, I found this book in the ""What's Wrong With My Daughter"" section of the bookstore."
7048	"All right, that's the last straw. It's time to take out the trash. But first, I'm going to have to ask you to leave."
7049	"Not so fast, Simpson."
7050	"Hey, could you take a look at a lump on my back?"
7051	Why don't you have the colonel's wife save you?
7052	"I know what you think: when stupid Homer wasn't looking, Bart got kidnapped by a monkey."
7053	A fifties-style restaurant.
7054	"All right, you, gimme back my phone, and nobody gets hurt."
7055	Do you think I could get a copy of it?
7056	"Homer, I have to go. If I don't make it, feel free to remarry -- from anyone on the list in the bulletin board in the closet."
7057	"Bart, you've always been a handful, but you've never interfered with my reproductive freedom. Why now?"
7058	She didn't say it yet!
7059	"Eh, don't worry, I'm sure I'll remember it."
7060	"Let's go now... Sa-winggg, batter!"
7061	"Whoa, a solid gold animal cracker."
7062	"Hmm, I thought it was Sandy Duncan."
7063	"I'm not used to strange men saying the word ""bedroom"" around me."
7064	"So that's it, isn't it, Marge? Looks. I didn't know you were so shallow."
7065	"You mean the revolver, sir?"
7066	"Nothing, sweetie, nothing! Here, let me explain."
7067	"Oh, when does the exercise start?"
7068	We're ditching our kids and taking a second honeymoon!
7069	"Very well, come on in. Perhaps I have something I can scald you with."
7070	"This is it, Maggie -- the place where Daddy goes every morning."
7071	"That's a good question, Bono. 'Cause I'd be the most wack, tripped-out Sanitation Commissioner ever! Can ya dig it?"
7072	"Anyhoo, the whole nightmare has really made us sleepy. Let's hit the hay."
7073	"You know-it-know it, Neddy."
7074	"Oh, it feels so good to talk to another human being. Stupid Flanders."
7075	"Homie, you want to read to Maggie before she goes to sleep?"
7076	"Yes, feel their hatred. It makes you strong, powerful... alive!"
7077	Well I'm gonna need full coverage -- my bully is highly aggressive. Check out these Indian burns.
7078	We're here to stop you -- with the help of the teenage abstinence class!
7079	Stupid rod. I got gypped.
7080	Grampa's been watching us.
7081	"Oh, it is, it is. But we've been pushing that poor horse too hard."
7082	Why eat hamburger when you can have steak?
7083	"I say this with love, you disrespectful skank. You've... had more... suddenly, I don't feel like doin' this."
7084	"Ooooh, that's some ball."
7085	"Mom, this is fascinating. Did you know that they'll stop Dad's heart for six whole minutes?"
7086	"Bart, didn't I ask you to watch Maggie?"
7087	"Excellent. Once again the wheel has turned and Dame Fortune has hugged Montgomery Burns to her sweet perfumed bosom. Somebody up there likes me, Smithers."
7088	"Aw, honey. I didn't realize how much that horn meant to you. Don't worry. Daddy's gonna get it back. I don't know how, but I'll figure out something."
7089	"I am so sick of doing her dirty work. She's taking advantage of us, Homer."
7090	Oooh. Recipe-related bumper cars.
7091	"Only three cavities, Bart. Your best check-up ever. I'm going to make you my specialty -- butterscotch chicken."
7092	Don't talk to me like I'm a client!
7093	Who designed this character? Probably a man...
7094	We'll get those kids back.
7095	"Eh, the Missus will clean that up."
7096	"Well, I'm not usually one to take the word of a Dane... plus, how can I afford it?"
7097	I really should read the whole headline before I react.
7098	"Ooh, three bean salad!"
7099	"Sven-Golly, born Svenjamin Golly, you are under arrest for mesmerizing the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame to induct Kiss."
7100	"Thanks, baby. Here, have a bracelet made of a seventies educational film strip."
7101	You're meeting with debt collectors and you don't want my help? Do you know how crazy that is?
7102	You've just made a powerful enemy.
7103	"I know, I know. Just tune her out."
7104	"Marge, this is so depressing. My only hope is this homemade Prozac. Hmm... needs more ice-cream."
7105	"So Mr. Burns wanted to kill Homer's dog. Homer had no idea -- he was so innocent and chubby. 'Course now, he's just stupid and fat."
7106	Put the noodles in the shed. There isn't gonna be a swimming pool.
7107	Noble idiot! Bring in the pie!
7108	"Look, I know I can't stop you. The only thing I can do is ask you to promise me you won't jump the gorge."
7109	She said she'd be wearing a plaid jumper.
7110	"Wow, you've had some career. Although the moral seems to be that a lifetime of jazz leaves you sad and lonely."
7111	"All good points. Sleep tight, my drunken angel."
7112	"Excuse me, have you seen this man?"
7113	"Lisa, I'm sorry you got a bad grade on your ""Moe and tell."""
7114	Remember when we saw Hunch's butt in the shower?
7115	"Lisa and Jesse, sittin' in a tree, k-i-s-s-i-n-g!"
7116	Thanks. I still can't believe the yellow and red cards don't stand for mustard and ketchup.
7117	"Marge, try to understand. There are two kinds of college students: jocks and nerds. As a jock, it is my duty to give nerds a hard time."
7118	Try the Flan De Leche De Cabra...
7119	Sounds like everything's going just the way I want it.
7120	"Oh, they both make such good arguments."
7121	This isn't very erotic. I think it's an actual utility room.
7122	Have you been eating that sandwich again?
7123	This basement is a wonderful gift to the family. But how could you afford it?
7124	I am not. It's just that I couldn't concentrate with that infernal racket. Lisa! Lisa!
7125	That's where the ice bridge would be! Go down!
7126	"Hmmm... try to frame criticisms of your spouse in a positive way."""
7127	Isn't this the greatest day ever?!
7128	Well then she can have you all to herself!
7129	"I want you to take baths, Bart."
7130	This man told you about these things?!
7131	"C'mon, just one more."
7132	"Ooo, Diego's not gonna like that."
7133	"Come on, kids. Daddy knows a way to get the money... with no risk."
7134	Good Lord! Did anyone get the license number?
7135	"Yeah, with that mental patient who thought he was Michael Jackson."
7136	Just a little Merloooot.
7137	"Like Halloween and Christmas, April Fool's Day traces its origins to pagan ritual."
7138	"However, federal law requires I keep one union worker on the payroll. So congratulations, whoever catches this bouquet."
7139	"Get off, you stupid dog!"
7140	I'm this close to having a comb-over!
7141	It's this new anti-crime dealie. The mayor turned the streetlights way up. My daughter Lisa feels really strongly about it.
7142	He is too! His truck's gonna come around the corner riiight now. Right now. Right now. Now. Now. Nnnnnnnnow. Now.
7143	"You saved me, Lis! For the rest of my life, you'll always be my ""one phone call."""
7144	"Now listen, son, I know we saw some awesome beat-downs tonight, but remember: don't try this at home. Do it at the schoolyard. Someplace where, if you get hurt, we can sue, not just them, but the school, the county, the state, and that jackass Joe Biden."
7145	Sit down! / You're breaking -- / Don't touch that--
7146	"Dad, you should blow the whistle on the Kwik-E-Mart."
7147	"Oh, I can't get the smell of slurry out of my clothes! I was a fool to help that horrible old man!"
7148	"Enjoy your tartar sauce, boys! Enjoy! Give me your plates. Don't crowd. Plenty for everybody."
7149	"I came to fight City Hall. I wanna shake things up, Patterson. Stir up some controversy. Rattle a few cages."
7150	"Mmm, thanks -- It looks... Hey, wait a minute! Just because I'm wearing a pink shirt, it doesn't mean I'm some kind of a... pink doughnut-eater! Although it is tempting --"
7151	"Come on, Bart. In your pre-Fascist days, you knew the giddy thrill of futile rebellion."
7152	Let's just go back to the condo -- we have to wash the dishes and do the sheets so it's nice for the next people.
7153	"Homer, I don't want you driving around in a car you built yourself."
7154	"Homer, for the last time, I am not putting that in."
7155	"Everything. And I learned it all from the greatest gangster film ever: ""Shark Tale""."
7156	"Marge, let me do a solo. This could be my big break."
7157	"Your new duties will include answering Mr. Burns' phone, preparing his tax return, moistening his eyeballs, assisting with his chewing and swallowing, lying to Congress, and some light typing."
7158	I'm so glad you washed that stupid logo off your head.
7159	Sorry. You've gotta admit it's catchy.
7160	I think that guy's a spy.
7161	"Uh, I'll take it from here, Ralph. Umm, we're just hangin', chillin'... little bit of illin'."
7162	"Look, can I please go to the movie?"
7163	"Ooh, let's pick him up!"
7164	But you'll kill both of us!
7165	All right! You can even have the dental plan!... On one condition. You must resign as head of the union.
7166	"Hey, I called for that!"
7167	I've never seen Bart so ashamed of me.
7168	"Rant on, Simpson, but your vainglorious boasting will only add savor to my inevitable triumph."
7169	I can't live with the guilt.
7170	"But on the other hand, when you don't take advantage of an opportunity, you can end up regretting it for the rest of your life."
7171	Cool! The wrong side of the tracks.
7172	"I changed my mind. It was a passing fancy. Although perhaps if you threw in a few lawn chairs, maybe that tool bench, it might rekindle my interest."
7173	...at the Springfield Smokestack Factory.
7174	"We should be bounty hunters together. You're kind and smart, I'm cruel and strong. Together, we're nothing. But together, we're the perfect bounty hunter."
7175	I thought you might want to snuggle.
7176	"All right, all right."
7177	"Well, Chief, don't quit your day job... heh, heh, heh... whatever that is."
7178	"Son, when you grew up, I grew down. But now I can see you need your Dad more than ever."
7179	No! You lie! Eliza Simpson can't be a coward! She's the only decent ancestor I have.
7180	Something's wrong. Terribly wrong.
7181	Drat! I wish that song were longer.
7182	Funny how many Germans say that these days.
7183	"Oh, I'm as tall as I ever was."
7184	"Hey, hey, premium cable subscribers! Tonight we've got the cast of the hit ""Boardwalk Vampire""..."
7185	"Ooh, how about ""Little Bo Peep?"""
7186	"Oh, I can't believe..."
7187	"Ooo, there's a big one. And it has freedom written all over it."
7188	"Seriously, folks, I really think we should stop this Hitler guy."
7189	At first I thought you were pointing to your crotch.
7190	"Quick, find the master log! There's always a master log."
7191	Wow. A baby and a free burger. Could this be the best day of my life?
7192	In the bathroom. Not trimmin' my mustache. Whaddaya think? Do I remind you of troubled troubadour David Crosby?
7193	"Slow down, fellas. I've got a way we can keep our legs, and still have a bright future."
7194	"I used to be lost. Until a friend turned me onto a book. A book that changed my life. It's called ""Lisa is Stupid."""
7195	Sure. It could be a story about people coming to terms with things.
7196	"All right penny, prepare to be pinched!"
7197	What is so funny? They're destroying the world!
7198	Does it have tomacco in it?
7199	"Oh yeah, she's always trying to improve mankind."
7200	Out of the way! I learned CPR while waiting for other kids to finish their math tests.
7201	"Oh, okay. I thought you were puttin' him down."
7202	Can I still drink it?
7203	"Yiddle my man, you're a genius."
7204	Which one do you want?
7205	"Homer, taking an officer's cap is an arrestable offense."
7206	I didn't make this terrible model... my dad did.
7207	"Lisa got to you. I don't know how, but she got to you."
7208	"Oh. Mr. Vice President... I've loved this time we've spent in this dormant volcano, but..."
7209	"Oh, meltdown is one of those annoying buzzwords. I prefer to call it an unrequested fission surplus."
7210	Drink deep from these cups.
7211	I'd like that very much.
7212	I think they've stopped. .
7213	"Hi, Marge. We're freaking out squares!"
7214	Fine. I'll come find you when I'm ready to stop having fun.
7215	Our wedding china's ruined.
7216	"Go on, Lisa. We've all got to be brave just like Jebediah when he killed that bear."
7217	"Hello, Principal Skinner."
7218	"Try something new, Homer. What'll it hurt you, Homer? I never heard of a poison pork chop."
7219	I can't take this anymore. Let's switch back.
7220	"Okay, boy, I wrote down exactly what to say. Just read it and you're a shoo-in."
7221	"Hey, it's not just a store. It's a ""mega"" store. ""Mega"" means ""good."" And ""store"" means ""thing."""
7222	"This is ridiculous. You've been through my delicates, my silkies, my dainties, and my unmentionables."
7223	I don't know why I agreed to this.
7224	I'm afraid handholding isn't going to cheer me up.
7225	"Aw, what a beautiful frame. Perfect for my day care permit. Sweet."
7226	"President Lincoln! You've come back, and you got rid of that hat -- you've got my vote!"
7227	"Good work, everyone. We're sure to be first in line for Duff Days."
7228	"Ooh, perfume. Meryl Streep's ""Versatility."""
7229	"Marge, I don't really want to go through with this... But being an astronaut is how I got you to respect me."
7230	I'll get a couple glasses.
7231	"Oh, thank God you're okay."
7232	"Mom, I can't go -- no one else is!"
7233	That was at my expense. What kind of a roast is this?
7234	"Come on, Bart. Afraid of a little apple juice?"
7235	I was making that cake for the block party today! Now there's no choice but to go... store-bought!
7236	Why won't you believe me?!
7237	Talk to him. Use your words.
7238	"And why do you really want it, anyway? Moe, will the gold bring back Edna's love?"
7239	Let's get rid of PBS. Those lousy Muppets have been taking food out of my mouth for too long.
7240	"Wayne, maybe it's the me being still alive talking, but I think you're awesome."
7241	No. Just a picture of Lisa. Who wants to be nothing like me.
7242	"I opened for the Who at Woodstock! I came out in a Beatle wig with a ukulele. Hendrix said he almost plotzed, his exact words."
7243	Time for your holiday gift!
7244	"Well, that's the last we'll see of them. Come on, we're goin' to Moe's."
7245	"Willie, I need to see the school security tapes."
7246	"Hey Lis, be a doll and hand me that sealant."
7247	"Annie, it's your first day on the set. Scream something nice."
7248	"I love you... Will you marry me, Marge?... You mean I'm gonna be a daddy?... I hope we'll always be together... together... together..."
7249	"Hm, the French have gotten into the wine game. Good luck catchin' up with the big boys."
7250	I'm just happy you're back. Now let's get that chain off you.
7251	"Oh, I get it. The government runs out of money, so they pass a bunch of lame-o laws to sock it to the little guy."
7252	"Now, Marge. Maggie was very young. It's not like we got so attached to her. No. Marge, isn't life funny? One day they're babies, the next thing you know, they're off on their own. Oh."
7253	"I'm bad to the bone, honey."
7254	"Whoa. It's like ""Speed 2,"" only with a bus instead of a boat."
7255	"You're right, I'm bored. Epoxy fight!"
7256	"Oy, this guy's tough."
7257	He's nailing something to our door.
7258	It didn't feel like success.
7259	"Reverend Lovejoy, Mrs. Lovejoy, Principal Skinner, Duffman."
7260	"I think it's great you've chosen to ""crash"" here, but do you have to be so messy?"
7261	"Say, sport, mind if I have the next dance?"
7262	"Stick your head out the window, boy. It's the greatest!"
7263	"Dad, I really want you to come on this trip with me!"
7264	Hello Kitty? I thought they were Spider-Man heads! Ew! Ew! Ew!
7265	I go on hikes with my friends where we talk about our problems.
7266	"Go out on a Tuesday? Who am I, Charlie Sheen?"
7267	What do you think? Should we stop here?
7268	"Homer, I think you dominoed this."
7269	You guys go ahead. I don't think I'd be very good company...
7270	"That's how they want you to feel. But if you just hang in there, they'll eventually accept you."
7271	"Yeah, if you want to change your image, you've got to get your face out there..."
7272	"Uh, you can pick him up tomorrow."
7273	Left below?! Where have I heard that before?
7274	"I'm gettin' that job. Bart, I'll need some clean urine. Stat."
7275	"Well, the fabric really brings out the red in your neck."
7276	"Ah, poor Homie. Poor, poor..."
7277	"I know you're a little peeved at Grampa, Dad, but you've done a wonderful thing."
7278	Hello. So... What brings you to America?
7279	"I think I'm done here. Lisa, go nuts."
7280	"No, just my marriage."
7281	"Well, at least I'm cool now!"
7282	This is Fat Load. I'd like to request a new codename.
7283	He's great at pointing out everyone's foibles!
7284	"Oh no, we'd never give him away, but, we're moving to another country where dogs are forbidden. Hear what? Oh, sure. C'mere, boy! Put that prowler down. Come here! Come on boy! Say it, boy! Say ""I love you"" for the nice man! I lub you. Good dog! Good doggie! Isn't that amazing? See you soon. Woooo! Wooo!"
7285	Oh. Are you sure you wanna have a baby this way?
7286	"All right, Comic Book Guy, tell me my origin story."
7287	"Homer, don't ever tell them personal stuff about me again."
7288	"People, please! I'm talking about toxic vapors."
7289	You did. His name was Stampy. You loved him.
7290	"Marge, to that I say boo, humbug."
7291	Ever notice how seats are too small for normal-looking guys like me? Theaters... airplanes... why even here. Look!
7292	"Oh, earrings! Wow, thank you so much, Alex. But these are for pierced ears."
7293	"Dad, the mailman is here."
7294	I'm gonna lose my job just 'cause I'm dangerously unqualified.
7295	"Well, um, I was looking through Mom's old schoolwork, and I noticed her grades went down when she started going out with you."
7296	"But we already did it. It took seven hours, but we did it. It's done."
7297	"And even though you knew I ratted you out to the IRS, you never busted me on it."
7298	"... LOVE YOU, SUCH A SWEET THING/ GOOD ENOUGH TO EAT THING..."
7299	Homer! We're not in high school.
7300	B-b-but the poncho...
7301	"Yeah, I thought I'd be happy with my parents back together, but it's kind of hollow."
7302	You made that TV show really mad.
7303	A LeatherBuddy! There's no limit to what I can do with this.
7304	Put that down! We're being audited!
7305	"And that's why I have trouble saying ""no"" to people -- even Gil!"
7306	Why did I do that? / It sounds so dull and boring. / What was I thinking?
7307	"Sure they are. They came from eggs in a bird's nest. Therefore, they're birds. Ixo fatso."
7308	"Mom, the girls' school is a joke and I'm not allowed to take the boys' math."
7309	"Oh. Hm, look at it this way. When you had breakfast this morning, did you pay for it?"
7310	That was great. You mind if I use that at work?
7311	What a sight! It happens every year like the swallows returning to Capistrano.
7312	"Okay, bad example. So let me ask you this, does your money ever hug you when you come home at night?"
7313	"No, it couldn't be..."
7314	"Wow, Lenny went all out!"
7315	Mrs. Krabappel sent me. I forged my dad's signature on my report card.
7316	I believe the sweet little girl in twenty-one D would disagree with you.
7317	"Go, go, go, go, go, go, go!"
7318	I actually did it -- a perfect vacation!
7319	That's the money tooth -- I heard the Tooth Fairy pays triple for it.
7320	"Everyone just act cool. If anyone asks, tell them we're plumbers... and then start plumbing until they go away."
7321	Crawling... so painful...
7322	Forget it. I'm not going.
7323	"Dad, I've done everything I could and I've only got thirty-five bucks. Ugh.. I am through with working. Working is for chumps."
7324	"Oh, don't fight. All great art is controversial at first. But years from now, people will point to these cuddly little creatures, and say, ""That's a Jack Crowley."""
7325	Don't forget Ken Starr.
7326	"Y'know, Homer, you might really benefit from opening your heart to the spirituality of this place. Please, neighbor?"
7327	"Dad, we'd love to stay here and listen to your amusing antidotes, but we have to take these coins to the mall and spend them."
7328	Isn't this 742 Evergreen Terrace?
7329	"Aw, look at him cower, just like the boy. I can't stay mad at such a helpless little mammal."
7330	MISS LUCY WENT TO HEAVEN AND THE STEAMBOAT WENT TO...
7331	"Fine. As long as I stand perfectly still and don't touch anything, I won't destroy the future."
7332	To protect and sever?
7333	That's ridiculous! How could I even get all five necessary drops into her cereal?
7334	Maybe it was the same person who tied each of the dog's feet to a toy car.
7335	Kids don't deliver newspapers anymore. It's just creeps in trucks.
7336	"That dummy worked like a charm, Dad."
7337	"This is your fault, with your non-threatening Bobby Sherman-style good looks. No girl could resist your charms."
7338	"Yeah, but at least it was short."
7339	"C'mon, Milhouse. Do you wanna play in the NBA or not?"
7340	"Not me -- but we can't get rid of him, 'cause he's friends with Richard Sakai."
7341	So Bart... the little dickens... was gonna set off an explosion to break us up. Can you believe it?
7342	"Say, is your butt numb from all this vibrating? Mine is. Still, I wouldn't describe it as unpleasant. Well, let's get some shut-eye."
7343	"Hmm, how about feature columnist?"
7344	"Mom, I know it's you."
7345	Stranded? What's that?
7346	"Whew! Just in the nick of... mmm, beer?"
7347	It's like God's vacuum cleaner!
7348	"Samantha, I went to Circus of Values to buy you a ten gallon tub of Gummy Bears."
7349	"Washing my fat guy hat, honey."
7350	"A sellout crowd at the Super Bowl, Simpson down by six with two seconds left! Simpson fades back. He's got Simpson in the open..."
7351	"Marge, you're speaking to me."
7352	"Damn you, Walt Whitman! I... hate... you... Walt... freakin'... Whitman! ""Leaves of Grass"" my ass! Wait a minute. Maybe it's that other grave. The one that says ""Simpson."""
7353	And a happy and healthy New Year.
7354	"As Springfield's youngest Buddhist, I am deeply honored to introduce the Dalai Lama."
7355	It's a symbol of what we can all do if we put our minds to it.
7356	"But it does break easily. Now this next one's for the ladies. How many times have you gals been late for a high-powered business meeting, only to realize you're not wearing makeup?"
7357	"What's the matter, boy?"
7358	I won sixty dollars last night.
7359	"Oh, come on Lis, you know why."
7360	"Well, before she died, she ordered this Bible especially for you."
7361	Lisa is very sensitive. If something she loves dies in front of her--
7362	Well... okay. I will volunteer!
7363	"See that? Krusty wore big floppy shoes but he's got little feet, like all good-hearted people."
7364	"Hey, if you want cool, check this out. EVERYBODY IF YOU CAN DO THE BARTMAN! SHAKE YOUR BODY TURN IT OUT IF YOU CAN CAN DO THE BARTMAN YEAH!"
7365	"Big Daddy, would y'all mind passin' a li'l ol' biscuit?"
7366	I can't believe it took us forty minutes to get here. Why can't they build a stamp museum closer to our house?
7367	I don't want a cellular transmitter sticking out of my roof!
7368	Ooo la la! It's Sideshow Melanie.
7369	Don't you know what kind of animal we're dealing with?
7370	"Guess what, Lurleen, I got you a gig on TV."
7371	Did you remember to disconnect it first?
7372	"Come on kids, we should go. Goodbye, Selma."
7373	Maggie! Don't talk with your mouth full.
7374	"At last, my plane shall be used for its original purpose. To subvert the laws of the United States."
7375	What are you two doing back there?
7376	He who reads this rune translation / will be taken to damnation.
7377	Couldn't you have just turned up the heat a little?
7378	"Maybe so, but I'd appreciate it if you didn't call them morons."
7379	"He created a cartoon called ""Danger Dog."" It's popular with kids and adults."
7380	"Hey, Lis, guess who's got a genuine Itchy and Scratchy animation cel?!"
7381	Party? No! No parties.
7382	"Oh, right. With the giant heads."
7383	Less news from the pews!
7384	"Look, he's heading back to the greyhound racing track where we found him!"
7385	"Stay there, honey. We'll come back for you."
7386	But he's out of his mind -- he can't run for President!
7387	"Oh, and uh... leave the costume."
7388	Let's approach with caution!
7389	"Ow! Bart, Nelson hit me!"
7390	A man who is good enough to shed his blood for the country is good enough to be given a square deal afterwards.
7391	"So, Bart, will you be joining me in the bucolic splendor of Kamp Krusty?"
7392	Don't worry. We got the cheese insurance.
7393	"Hey, it's me, Bart. Your biggest fan?"
7394	What the heck are these?
7395	"Lisa, we love you and we're not trying to put any pressure on you."
7396	"In the beginning of the school year, each of you received a colored ticket. I hope everyone still has theirs."
7397	"Yeah, and your father's ""No House."" Now scram."
7398	...SEND HER HOME WITH ACHING TUM!
7399	It's very late in the marriage to tell me that.
7400	"Crawling! Oh, he's really gone. He's gone!"
7401	"Come on, pony up, Flanders. The kid's not turning tricks for nothin'."
7402	"Look, we've been down this road before. I do something stupid, your Mom leaves, we eat waffles."
7403	The truth is... I'm dying.
7404	"No question, I gotta freshen up my act. Jay, you're a professional comedian, right? Right? Answer me."
7405	"Okay kids, you can keep him."
7406	That's because you keep passing out on our lawn.
7407	"Oh, he's leaving her with five babies."
7408	"Let's go around the table, and everybody say one amazing thing that happened to them today. Lisa?"
7409	Look at those pants. They're standing up with no one in them.
7410	"Don't worry, Homer. You don't need Mary Jane to laugh at Mr. Burns' jokes. Just picture him naked."
7411	I want this Simpson fellow to perform comedy at my party. I must harness his fractured take on modern life.
7412	"Oh, Mr. Van Houten, I love when you kiss me! Yeah, yeah, kissing ladies is the best. Oh baby, kiss my mouth. Kiss me like we're in a fancy hotel."
7413	My name is Jimbo Jones and I live at 1094 Evergreen Terrace.
7414	"But you think there's like a kernel of good inside me, right?"
7415	"Lisa, honey you spelled the word wrong, but you did the right thing."
7416	"North Dakota, here we come!"
7417	No snacks! Dinner will be ready in three minutes!
7418	"I thought I had a great idea, but I must've seen it on this poster."
7419	It's not a big deal. We'll just go to City Hall and get married there.
7420	"I'm sorry, but as a filmmaker I have to face the truth."
7421	I couldn't help it! She knew my one weakness -- that I'm weak!
7422	"You tell him, Jesminder!"
7423	"Hey, we owe this guy. And I don't want you calling him a sissy. This guy's a fruit! And a -- No, wait, wait, wait -- ""queer!"" Queer, queer. That's what you like to be called, right?"
7424	I thought I was your arch-enemy.
7425	The bed is lifting me! The elevator at work can't even do that! I demand you put me down right after the sex!
7426	"Oh, wait! Here's a good one -- ""do""."
7427	Jeepers H. Crackers! I'd better call the Reverend!
7428	"Ruth Powers, my old neighbor? Oh, my goodness, look at you!"
7429	Van Houten blows past Simpson. He's got all the right moves...
7430	Just because Maggie can't talk doesn't mean she's dumb -- Einstein didn't speak 'til he was three.
7431	Yeah. A crazy guy shot a bunch of people and the subway ran over my hat.
7432	"Bart Simpson, I'm just big-boned."
7433	Fine. I'll never ever do another stupid thing. Good night!
7434	Just try and stop me.
7435	Oh. I thought maybe you were some kind of Indian mystic who could tell the future.
7436	I heard in study hall you were babysitting tonight.
7437	HEY BIG MAN / DON'T WANT NO TROUBLE / I'M JUST HERE TO DO THE SUPER BOWL... SHUFFLE...
7438	"Just remember, son, whatever happens --I'll always love you."
7439	"So freaking far in the ground, baby."
7440	The system works! I've become enchanted and illusioned with Washington.
7441	What are you trying to say?
7442	"Anyway, I made a list."
7443	"Ned, I'm worried about you. You've been working non-stop for the past week."
7444	"I build up a little steam, and..."
7445	"Funny how the brain does that, huh?"
7446	I don't believe it! Principal Skinner!
7447	"You two are the kind of tenants every landlord dreams of: excellent credit, Christian but not Baptist, and let's see: according to your application you only have sex for procreation."
7448	A picture of me with a smiling child?! I can get my plant back!
7449	"Okay! Wait a minute. That's bad! Look, I know I'm not witty like that critic guy. But does he know all the words to the Oscar Mayer song?"
7450	"You know, Marge, we got a pretty good kid there."
7451	"Ooo, Ned, look who's here. It's that girl you don't like... not!"
7452	"Ooh... How about the ""V""?"
7453	"Hey, kids, I just heard they cancelled league night down at the bowling alley. You know what that means -- open lanes!"
7454	"No, not until you earn it. Until then, I will never see you as my equal."
7455	"Were you talking to me, Grampa?"
7456	Have you seen my sister?
7457	"Oh, it's Lisa. That's ours."
7458	"I'm really sorry I hit you, Mr. Burns. Here, let me put some salt on that eye."
7459	"Hmmm. Wow! Dad's been in jail six times. Aw, and Mom's only been in twice."
7460	It'll be real soon enough.
7461	"For the first time in my life, people weren't laughing at me, they were laughing towards me."
7462	No soldier left behind.
7463	"Well... if that's going to be your attitude, I'm not going to untie you."
7464	"He's taking on Mean Man Monty! Go get him, Honest Abe!"
7465	"Hey Lou, could you shake out the last few drops for me?"
7466	"Well, we're having the best Spring Break of our lives, and we don't need you around nerding it up."
7467	Thank you for stopping the tank.
7468	I am a God! I know all!
7469	It's weird -- I just made an entire town lose its lunch...
7470	"Dad, it's just that too much of your love can really be... scary."
7471	"People, please. The only way Lisa can bust me is if she finds someone who can prove I was at that rap show. And I know just where she can find that someone. Let's go cover our asses!"
7472	"Well, it could be a good chance to get to know our neighbors outside of a courtroom setting."
7473	I-I'd like to borrow five thousand dollars.
7474	"Oh. It can't be that many. C'mon, Apu. I'll be your tutor."
7475	May I ask how you spent your weekend?
7476	Mr. Flanders invited us to Israel. I think he wants to get Dad into Heaven.
7477	"I'unno. What am I, Superdad?"
7478	"You ask for my help, then you don't want it."
7479	"Well, that might be interesting... or it could damage many, many lives."
7480	Apu sang a song. What are you gonna do?
7481	Are you saying we won't see my family again?
7482	Professor Digglesby's wand! Now I have every wizarding stick from the Spells and Potions Department of Wagglepoofs Academy!
7483	You talk pretty tough for a man without health insurance!
7484	All worth it for Marge!
7485	"Oh, Mr. Burns, we'll thaw you out the second they discover the cure for seventeen stab wounds in the back."
7486	Dying is just like golfing. Except in golf...
7487	"Mom, can we talk to you?"
7488	"Well, she won first prize in the Springfield Art Fair, and as the wife of an employee, she'll be easily intimidated."
7489	"Girls are yucky, seconded and carried. A fart was detected, Martin denied it and so was ruled to have supplied it."
7490	But you're not even using them.
7491	"Thanks, guys. Tomorrow morning my sheets will be as dry as the surface of Mars except for the poles."
7492	"Hi, little eggs. I'm not sure how to tell you this, but... Y-Your mom was involved in an incident. Mistakes were made. By me. But don't worry, I'll take care of you."
7493	Maggie's locked inside!
7494	"OH THE FARMER AND THE COWMAN SHOULD BE FRIENDS / OH, THE FARMER AND THE COWMAN SHOULD BE FRIENDS"
7495	"No, Flanders. It's... uh... a meeting of gay witches for abortion. You wouldn't be interested."
7496	"Oh, great. So I'm dead now? Fine, I'm sick of this stupid game anyway."
7497	Can't we just keep going forward in our textbooks?
7498	"Oh, here we go again. Look, I don't care if Ned Flanders is the nicest guy in the world, he's a jerk. End of story."
7499	See? A new pacifier for Maggie.
7500	We'll let the authorities sort that out.
7501	Lousy. I gotta go to Vermont for some stupid poetry thing.
7502	"Now, Homer, go easy on the al-ky-hol. Remember last year at the Winfield's party when you threw up in the laundry hamper?"
7503	"Okay, but it's my first time."
7504	Kids-here's-fifty-dollars-Why-not-go-to-the-movies-then-take-a-cab-to-your-Aunts'-house-Stay-there-Phone-call-you-later-Now-Now-Now.
7505	It's happening again!
7506	"Yeah, my wife is raking it in."
7507	"Kwik-E-Mart hot dog, eh?"
7508	I got phi beta cappuccinos for Ned's pre-meds!
7509	"Now, would you care for some sushi?"
7510	Jazz. They just make it up as they go along. I could do that. Dee dee dee dee dee dee dee dee dee dee dee dee dee.
7511	"Flanders, I decided I'd like to go to the game with you."
7512	"Well, then, where's my stuffed mother?!"
7513	Gather 'round kids. We're about to enter the museum...
7514	"President-Elect. I could've been President, but I'm too real. People can't deal with what I'm layin' down. They're just like, ""Whoa, dude, you can't say that."" And I'm like, ""Watch me."""
7515	"There are perfectly logical explanations for everything that happened. The bonfire sent soot into the air which created rain. And with all the trees cut down, a flood was inevitable."
7516	"Here's your skates. Oh, you'll have to take off those boots."
7517	But I thought you still loved him.
7518	Even if he killed you and made your teeth into piano keys?
7519	Things happened between your mother and me that we're not proud of. It was the middle of a wild decade known as the nineteen nineties.
7520	It's time to harvest our radioactive supercrop!
7521	"Wait a minute. If Lisa goes to school then I go to school, but then Lisa stays home so I stay home, so Lisa goes to school..."
7522	Free Duff! Viva life!
7523	"It's so beautiful and modern. Ooh, a Sub-Zero fridge..."
7524	Every week we have to buy something else to save that transforming clown that morphs! I want you to watch a show that isn't just one long commercial!
7525	"Uh, let's talk about this outside."
7526	"You haven't been issued a map yet. When you arrive at the cabin, there will be a congratulatory party with sandwiches and moderately priced champagne."
7527	"Sorry, can't hear you. Bye-bye!"
7528	"Look, I came to talk about my husband, and... How did we get in here?"
7529	"Well if you love it so much, why are you always littering?"
7530	"If someone did eat Bart's shorts, they'd have a tummy full of pocket garbage!"
7531	"Oh, you betcha! You know, they got velcro straps, a water pump in the tongue, built-in pedometer, reflective sidewalls and little vanity license plates."
7532	Would you... Stop that! You're a helper monkey. This isn't helping!
7533	No dessert until you eat your broccoli.
7534	"Lis, I don't get it. Why does Milhouse's happiness make me sad?"
7535	Valhalla is where Vikings go when they die.
7536	"Tres bien. Well, I should probably be going. I have a big Forensics meet tomorrow."
7537	Scary ways. But we never intended it to end like that. With thousands of people staring at our naked bodies.
7538	"It already is killing me, Marge. You're the only one I can talk to. My wife just doesn't get it."
7539	"Please, you've gotta let me back in. I sold six thousand rolls of wrapping paper to get here!"
7540	Everyone's having fun but me.
7541	This is my mother's eightieth birthday party and you're not ruining it. You'll have a good time. I invited a friend for you.
7542	I hope all you kids come out this weekend and really pack this place just to show 'em how grateful I am. I told them you would. Don't make me a liar.
7543	"Use as many big words as possible. I call ""computer."" Bart, you can have ""doorbell."""
7544	"Ah. Well, you do have a present under the tree. I guess no one told Santa you were a Buddhist."
7545	"Excuse me, but isn't that voice very similar to the Cowardly Lion?"
7546	After this we'll do makeovers!
7547	You'll thank me when we're frying up a big juicy fish.
7548	Thank you. Give the bully an extra point.
7549	You're not done. I want you to throw away these old calendars and TV Guides.
7550	"Hey, where is everybody?"
7551	"Those are all moderately cool ideas, but if you really want to walk on the wild side, I know just the place."
7552	"Really? Well, that's great, Dad. How can I ever repay you?"
7553	"Oh, c'mon. I've had a rough day."
7554	"Well, hey, it's Homer! Good to see ya, neighb--"
7555	Uh huh. Uh huh. Uh huh.
7556	Get my filthy hands off my sister!
7557	"We know, Dad. We were there."
7558	"Grieving father, comin' through..."
7559	"Hey, Burns! Hey, ""Rag Arm""!"
7560	That's even worse than the album Grampa released.
7561	And I'll find out what a Mayor does!
7562	"I heard a wonderful saying today: ""forgive and forget."""
7563	I'll throw in some Christian comic books!
7564	"Yeah, after I stopped drinking, this was a way to stay close to my bottles."
7565	"Homer, I don't think there's a problem with Bart. But if there is, it's probably because you're not spending any time with him. Goodnight."
7566	"Put a lid on it, Simpson. There's no ""I"" in ""team""."
7567	"Because I was saving that for my birthday. Now, c'mon!"
7568	"You, look what you've done! My starting pitcher thinks he's a chicken! Make no mistake, I'm going to report this to the American Hypnotical Association."
7569	"Back in a moment, my dear. We have to, uh... uh... expel some urine."
7570	Could you use it in a sentence?
7571	Now I'm ready to hit the town.
7572	AND THEY'RE ALL MINE...
7573	It encapsulates America and makes history come alive!
7574	"Hey, Flanders! Thanks for saving our place."
7575	"Look, it's the telescope I won at the Optics Festival."
7576	"Look, you're a sweet kid, but I'm not exactly father material. I curse, I gamble, I pick fights with homeless people... I..."
7577	"Well, all that money sounds mighty tempting, Marty. But I think I'm gonna have to go with the elephant."
7578	"Uh, that's what we call the gay guy who lives with us."
7579	"Well, it looks like we've found this plant's one remaining worker of bone and sinew."
7580	You can't fire me just because I'm married. I'm going to sue the pants off you.
7581	Martians? You do know that radio broadcast was a hoax?
7582	"Yeah, yeah. Thank you, Mel. But I am not here to talk about myself. Milhouse, would you join me at the podium?"
7583	Now your freak flag's flying! Let the freak-out begin! Woo hoo!
7584	"Oh, they're leaving! The ordeal is over!"
7585	"Yoink! Foiled again, freak!"
7586	I did a lot of research on Jebediah Springfield and...
7587	"Oh, that is it. I am tired of being pushed around by grownups! It's time to fight back!"
7588	"I was in heaven. If horse racing is the sport of kings, then surely bowling... is a very good sport as well."
7589	Are you gonna walk upstairs and ask her?
7590	Now that's what I call a snappy retort!
7591	"These new vending machine snacks are crammed with processed sugar, industrial byproducts and trans-fatty acids!"
7592	Lemme just finish this last lobster tail and raspberry torte.
7593	Can't I water ski a little bit?
7594	"Oh my, look at all these letters from people who want to be Bart's People, Bart."
7595	"Dad, those are just the names of the quizzes. You're supposed to open the magazine."
7596	"Hurry, my little Puritans -- we must flee England and its insufficiently Puritanical ways."
7597	"Dammit, she knows! Okay, how do we buy your silence?"
7598	"Oh, if only I were in Springfield, all my friends would be cheering me on. Oh, God, I'm delirious!"
7599	It's the first day of school!
7600	"Stop saying that, Dad."
7601	"To start, press any key. Where's the ""any"" key?"
7602	"Nelson, I'm afraid I'm going to have to teach you a lesson."
7603	"Not easy to juggle a pregnant wife and a troubled child, but somehow I managed to fit in eight hours of TV a day."
7604	"All right, how's this for a wager? A batch of your wife's delicious blueberry muffins against one of my wife's homemade wind chimes!"
7605	"Uh, you die eating a submarine sandwich."
7606	I come to deliver a terrifying message of hope. Grab your guns and follow me!
7607	Wait! The burger didn't change me! I'm not a muncher!
7608	Will you stop acting so jealous?
7609	"From what, too much hot fudge? Huh? C'mon Bart, show me some love!"
7610	"It's gonna be ""yes,"" but don't rush me."
7611	We're safe because you have to climb steps to get up here.
7612	"To prove my brother's innocence, I demand a youth court!"
7613	"That won't help, Dad. No one's ever going to believe me."
7614	"Oh, me and my trenchant mouth."
7615	"All right, you googly-eyed geezers, turn up your hearing aids -- I've got something to say."
7616	Then came my big break. A Talmudic conference in the Catskills and I was the entertainment.
7617	"Well, it's easier to chew than that Bambi video."
7618	"Sir, you could improve your image with various good deeds."
7619	This proves Bart lied about being kidnapped!
7620	"It's just an expression, Marge."
7621	I've got some stuff to put a smile on that corpse.
7622	Stupid bug. You go squish now.
7623	"I don't know, how come you're not at school?"
7624	Oh my God! These are the answers to the test! I don't wanna cheat!
7625	It's hard to believe someone that young could have risen to the rank of Admiral.
7626	"I'm so glad you picked the Museum of Natural History, Mom."
7627	"Oh, I'm sorry. I have been spending too much time at the casino. I'll be around more from now on."
7628	The other critics told me to be mean. And you should always give in to peer pressure.
7629	All I wanted to do was join a group of women who wore the same outfits.
7630	We're building homes for the homeless.
7631	Heave-ho! Heave-ho! Heave-ho! Heave-ho! Heave-ho!
7632	"I like eating here with you, Dad. Especially without ""Don't have a cow, man."""
7633	Ha! Smart move. Soon the whole world will be lining up to suck my nose. After I make my new client a star.
7634	"Okay, don't panic. Remember what the instructor said..."
7635	What? Well that's a hell of a thing! Why?
7636	"Hey sweetie, is Mom winning?"
7637	What happened to Mr. Murphy?
7638	"So, what do you think?"
7639	They're fighting in the car again.
7640	"Dad, wait, I've got a story about why revenge is wrong."
7641	And there's no hard feelings?
7642	I'm having chest pains!
7643	"Uh-huh. Okay, we'll be back with help before you know it. You girls just stay here and relax."
7644	I'll get mini-dumpsters of wings from Garbage Wings!
7645	Good. We can use that.
7646	Are you here to solve my ketchup problem?
7647	"But I always get A's. At my old school, I got so many A's, the teachers didn't even check my work."
7648	"Um, wait, I forgot the words."
7649	"All right, smart guy. Where's the fire?"
7650	"That's it? Well, that's Marge. Big deal. Great spiritual quest, wolfie. My soul mate is Marge."
7651	"You know, I think your sister could use a little help washing the car."
7652	Now here's that bully of yours. Show me your stuff.
7653	"Hey you goats, get outta here!"
7654	I guess an open garage isn't the best hiding place.
7655	It's just a little dirty -- It's still good! It's still good!
7656	"Oh sure, put down a simple guy like me, who works hard and plays by the rules!"
7657	Shh! This plot is hard enough to follow as it is.
7658	"Oh, he did, did he? I'll show him! I'll bring you a weapon of unimaginable destructive power!"
7659	"Milhouse, a little salt?"
7660	"Youngest daughter... Well, how about this? This thing says my mother's still alive. She died when I was a kid."
7661	It's mac and cheese from the school cafeteria. The blandest food known to man.
7662	"When Virginia Woolf wrote ""every woman needs a room of one's own,"" she must have been talking about the kitchen."
7663	"Krusty here to cheer you up as part of the hospital's ""Last Laugh Program."""
7664	"I know you feel bad about the juice incident, but I'm sure you can make up for it somehow."
7665	"Dad, we're not in their area code anymore."
7666	That was some New Years. Now listen. I think we should consider breaking your parents up again.
7667	You told me you liked it! You didn't read it at all! You lied to me!
7668	We touched hands and then we had to wash the cooties off.
7669	EATING MAKES ME THIRS-TY
7670	"Well, I guess we have to go to an art gallery and buy a new painting."
7671	"Lis, that place is great! They have a jukebox in the basement! And look at the trick they taught me!"
7672	"I can't believe you're giving up church, Homer."
7673	"Listen, Bub. We are out of the marriage counseling business. And the only one you should be giving chicken grease neck rubs to is me. But not me, 'cause I think they're disgusting."
7674	"Boy, it's really empty in here."
7675	Couldn't agree more. Happy as a clam.
7676	"Oh, I don't want to be a bother. Anyway, what are you two big Hollywood stars doing in good ol' Springfield?"
7677	"Y'know, I feel sorry for you, kid. Going back to that cold, loveless family."
7678	Marriage is so tough. Every second it could explode catastrophically. Makes me not want to come home from my job at the nuclear plant.
7679	No idea. The important thing is that they did.
7680	I'm picking the next thing.
7681	"Homer, did you tell the Mafia they could eliminate my competitors with savage beatings and attempted murder?"
7682	Who's the first one again?
7683	Another man... with my wife... in my house... on top of my TV Guide?
7684	Don't tell me where I go. A dollar? What for?
7685	Well... it might be cold outside.
7686	"Bart, where are you?! Come on! I have to be up at six a.m. to swipe Flanders' newspaper!"
7687	"Yeah, but uh-- One of those I dialed nine-one-one by mistake, but I was too embarrassed to admit it, so I set the house on fire. It feels good to tell the truth. No, I'm lying again, it feels bad."
7688	"You know, I think Milhouse is ""El Barto."" Hmmmm."
7689	"Yes, our tiny tapper. What was it you were going to say after ""I wanted to be a dancer, but..."""
7690	I can't think with all this noise!
7691	YOU'VE GOT TO LOVE TO BE HATED /
7692	"Hey, hey! Ha. Ha. It's you. Right? Yeah, ha, ha. And this guy, uh -- with all the jokes he does..."
7693	How about Krusty the Clown?
7694	I didn't really check. I mainly bought this house for the view.
7695	That sounds like Fat Tony.
7696	"That's all it takes. If we learned one thing from ""The Amazing Colossal Man,"" and ""Grasshopperus,"" it's that radiation makes stuff grow real big, real fast."
7697	It's gonna take me weeks to get the booger wall back up.
7698	"Priceless like a mother's love, or the good kind of priceless?"
7699	"Uh, I wasn't talking about you, Dad."
7700	"Mom, we didn't know each other very well. If we did, you never would have asked me to climb anything. But even when you weren't around, I always felt good, knowing you were out there somewhere."
7701	"Homer, those are ice cream men."
7702	I want you to give up beer for a month.
7703	Get out--! What do they call it?
7704	"Ooo, I think he's a keeper."
7705	Earl. My new friend's name is Earl!
7706	"You were my favorite uncle, Uncle Otto."
7707	Chauffeur... seamstress...
7708	You can't even show it in the bar?
7709	"Great, but why am I on a plane?"
7710	"Krusty, you've let everyone down. And even worse, you've let down this sacred document."
7711	"Boy, come here and listen to Lisa's story. It's about Moe's treasure!"
7712	"I'll let you try them on, right after I decide if these videos are ""Funny Or Die"". Funny, funny, die, die, funny, funny but the guy died..."
7713	Now let's hear it for a great American... former president Gerald Ford.
7714	I'll take ten bucks no-ow.
7715	Well maybe pulling pranks is the only thing I'm good at.
7716	"Uh, yeah. I need something that'll keep me awake, alert, and reckless all night long."
7717	Then we star-wipe to Flanders brushing his...
7718	"Don't worry, Mom. They all passed by."
7719	"I don't know, I don't know! I'm sure I don't know!"
7720	"Sweetheart, what's wrong?"
7721	Woo hoo! In your little faces!
7722	"I'M NOT THAT COOL, I DON'T WEAR JEANS / I'VE POLISHED AN APPLE OR TWO / BUT EVERY GRADE THAT I GRUBBED, I GRUBBED IT FOR YOU... / SO CALL ME BOOKWORM / BUT I'LL NEVER SQUIRM, WHEN THERE'S WORK TO BE DONE / YES I'LL TAKE MY LUNCH AT MY DESK / WHILE YOU'RE ALL OUTSIDE HAVING FUN..."
7723	"Wow, that's what I would've said. Well, I would've said ""polite and clean,"" but wow, still..."
7724	Pink frosting fixes everything!
7725	"Hey, no, no, what do you think you're--"
7726	"I mean, unless he had been a little nicer at the beach."
7727	I'm alive! I'm alive. And I owe it all to this feisty feline.
7728	I miss Bart! I can't leave him in that awful camp!
7729	"Look man, you've got to enjoy yourself a little. You work hard, or at least you're out of the house a lot."
7730	What have I told you about comical entrances?
7731	"Kids, your daddy and his daddy are involved in a very sticky... nutty... chewy... chocolatey... Put it away, boy... situation. And your daddy has realized something very important: a father should always make his kids feel wanted. Starting right now, I promise to spend a lot more time with you and give you the attention you deserve."
7732	"But Marge, valets. For once, maybe someone will call me ""Sir,"" without adding ""you're making a scene."""
7733	"What are you talking about? Oh, geez."
7734	"Thanks for the tip, Homer."
7735	Victory for the middle child!
7736	"Well, not dead, dying. No, no, no, no. Don't walk away. Wait. How 'bout this: just show me the knife. In your back. Not too deep, but, uh, it should be able to stand by itself."
7737	"I'm afraid he's got us, sir."
7738	"Homer, I don't need fancy things. And even if I did, this is the wrong way to get them."
7739	Mom! I know what I want for Christmas.
7740	"Oh yeah, three bad nightmares."
7741	Only if they have five dollars.
7742	"Wait! Joy of movement increasing... Love of dance, impossible to resist... Toes twinkling... Look at me, girls. I'm doing ballet...and I love it!"
7743	I get it. Everything's made of blocks. Even the water.
7744	Oh! They're here! How does everything look?
7745	"C'mon, big guy. This'll help you get to sleep."
7746	I'm gonna win and it'll change my life!
7747	"In an average week, how many braised ribs do you eat? Marge, do you think that counts honey-braised?"
7748	"Don't worry, we have plenty of supplies to get through tomorrow. And then a wave of disease should help to -- hey!"
7749	"There they go. Two criminal geniuses, locked away together.... Who knows what diabolical scheme they might concoct?"
7750	"Marge, you know that batting this lightbulb is the only thing that cheers me up after giving away those million dollar greyhounds."
7751	Race ya to the swimmin' hole!
7752	"I said, pull my finger."
7753	"Stop! Leave Milhouse alone! Help me out here, Bart."
7754	"And no matter what happens, I'll never forget the advice you gave me."
7755	It's El Flanderito! Run him down!
7756	"No Yu, the Chinese Clown?"
7757	...And then he claimed he was the one who turned cats and dogs against each other. Why is he always making up those crazy stories?
7758	"Fine, get it. Lets go."
7759	"Well, one time I read this boring comic book about a ship called ""The Bounty..."""
7760	I WAS A PARCHED WIDDLE SEEDLING...
7761	This is the greatest invention in the world! You'll make a million dollars!
7762	Can I have one hour of grownup time where you two aren't tattling on each other or using obscure references?
7763	"No, Artie, Artie. The best argument is that I've known and respected you for eight years, and I would be delighted to go to the prom with you."
7764	"It's not yours, Bart! This is family glue!"
7765	You came to the right guy. I'll straighten ya out... right after I finish this beer.
7766	"Your clownish behavior notwithstanding, we have made a gentleman's agreement and sworn on our lives to honor it."
7767	"Man, when's the last time Moe cleaned this?"
7768	"Yeah, Bart. You're supposed to be developing verbal abilities for your big aptitude test tomorrow."
7769	Oh! But isn't this the 22?
7770	"Now that my soft, chestnut mane is gone, I dream of cutting hair, styling hair, making hair shorter in exchange for money... maybe I should open a hair salon."
7771	"Marge, I'm taking Lisa out of that stupid-- What the?"
7772	"OK... We're young, rich and full of sugar. What do we do?"
7773	"Don't worry. We'll catch him, or run him over tryin'."
7774	"Orwell, obscure? The author of ""Animal Farm?"""
7775	Geez. You're pretty uppity for someone who eats bugs all day.
7776	"Hey, Bart, watch me run down this old lady."
7777	Where am I... the Planet Cornball?
7778	Interesting attitude for a janitor. What say we make you the new supervisor of Sector 7-G?!
7779	"Kids, come back in the house!"
7780	Shut up! You don't know her! Zelda loves me! I HATE THIS HOUSE!
7781	Are you sure we can make money doing this? What if nobody wants their address painted on the curb?
7782	I already have one of those.
7783	"Oh, can you sing it again?"
7784	"Well, make sure you don't. And try not to let your brother get under your skin."
7785	"Honey, no one's going to force you to do anything... but do you know how your father got the money to enter you in this pageant?"
7786	You've said that three times already!
7787	"So Mr. Cooder, how long have you been in the traveling amusement industry?"
7788	"Marge, I guess we'll just have to make love in Heaven. I'll bet it always works up there."
7789	"Hurry, Moe. At three o'clock they're going to put us in the exercise yard. The exercise yard!"
7790	Ow! That had a guide pin in it.
7791	"No, my invention! All my money problems could've..."
7792	"Oh, here we go with the fat-cat bashing."
7793	"Play along, Chubsy. There's a pie in it for you."
7794	"But I want to help people, not kill 'em."
7795	"Look, the room came with a fruit hat."
7796	And that takes care of that.
7797	Yes! Will I get to meet Dave?
7798	"Well, I kind of like this guy..."
7799	...I could never even look at Eliza again. It didn't help that the next day he drank bad well water and went blind.
7800	Here ya go. Have some more.
7801	One of us! Gooble goo!
7802	"Hey, don't blame me, I voted for the green M&M."
7803	GLOWING RODS / GLOWING RODS / IT'S MAKING ME / WEAK AND DIZZY...
7804	"Come on, we'll have a blast. Kids, while we're out, the TV's in charge. Go to bed when it says."
7805	"Yeah, that's his thing. Anyway, Fat Tony and I think this is a chance to patch things up between you and Selma. Plus it's a free weekend at the beach."
7806	I tried greasing the bucket with bacon fat but your father kept eating it.
7807	"Bart, pass the corn. Bart, pass the corn!"
7808	I've never seen Marge want to go somewhere so badly. I'm gonna take her back there... by burning that home movie onto a DVD.
7809	"Checkin' out a cave is gonna be awesome! It'll be dark, with rocks, and mineral formations, and plants that have adapted to harsh-- Wait a minute! This is a scam -- we're on a nature walk!"
7810	You're about to learn the two most dangerous words in the English language are Marge Simpson!
7811	"One glazed and one scratch-and-win, please."
7812	Why do you talk that way?
7813	"I don't think so, either."
7814	"Singer of Yentl, thirteen letters... um..."
7815	I know a place where no one in town will see us.
7816	"Mmmmm... Ewwww.... Mmmmm...Ohhh... Mmmmm... Ahhhh. Ooh, I think this was pizza."
7817	Homer my Mother's party's starting any minute. Get busy.
7818	I guess you're not going to have an adventure this week.
7819	"No, it was the happiest night of my life! The warm Spring air, the swings I took in the batting cage afterwards... Don't you remember, darling?"
7820	"Now Apu, when you gave me this keg it had dents. And here's proof."
7821	Went to practice her Portuguese.
7822	"Hey, the bathroom's a block away."
7823	"Oh, come on, I do plenty around here! Lisa never lifts a finger. Why don't you go yell at her?"
7824	Good boy. Good boy. Show us where the food is.
7825	Cool! An oversized novelty billiard ball.
7826	"Excuse me, but you don't sound as tough as you do in the movies."
7827	"Marge, I don't want to buy this house. I'd have to live next door to myself."
7828	"But I don't want them cutting up my soft, supple body. Why didn't somebody tell me what I was volunteering for? This is everybody's fault but mine."
7829	"Hey, hey! What are you doing?"
7830	How about a bite of the world's biggest Brussels sprout?
7831	"Everything I did, I did for you."
7832	I've called you all here because I need some honest answers. What is my current financial situation?
7833	"Well, there's no house to put it in, Homer, not since that nice fellow from the bank, who was only doing his job, came and locked it up."
7834	"Oh, yeah. Here they are."
7835	"Switch, switch, switch."
7836	Hampster two... Bart zero...
7837	It's totally unfair for one side to have a professional player.
7838	"Well, as much as humanly possible."
7839	Maybe I should go on anti-psychotic meds.
7840	"Okay, here are your tickets. They're supposed to be good. You're sitting with the player's wives. And don't forget to cheer for me."
7841	You're a very selfish man.
7842	"I'm worried about the kids, Homie. Lisa's becoming very obsessive. This morning I caught her trying to dissect her own rain coat."
7843	Hysterical pregnancy?
7844	Oh God! We're going down! I don't wanna die next to Kathy Griffin!
7845	"Say it, don't spray it."
7846	I believe the key to bully-nerd antagonism lies in your drippings.
7847	"I hope you're happy, Bart. Thanks to your hi-jinx, I have to drive you and your friends to school."
7848	"Wow, it's been so long since I've been with someone who doesn't know what a selfish pig I am."
7849	You're gonna get a bath tonight.
7850	Last night you had the night terrors.
7851	Ladies and gentlemen... Krusty the Clown is dead!
7852	Be intimate with Marge.
7853	"Also, gerontological studies have demonstrated that animal companions can slow the inevitable decline of--"
7854	"... He drinks out of the carton. He never changes the baby. When he goes to sleep, he makes chewing noises and when he wakes up he makes honking noises. Oh... oh... and he scratches himself with his keys. I guess that's it. Oh no. Wait. He kicks me in his sleep and his toenails are too long and yellow. That's all I can think of right now. I guess you're all tired and I want to thank you for letting me get some things off my chest."
7855	"Aw, what happened now? Did the rubble burn down?"
7856	"How 'bout ""Diet Coke -- the Movie?""... ""President Air Bud: Tail To The Chief?""... ""My Big Fat Greek Salad?"""
7857	"Hey, this one's from you."
7858	"See, honey? All you needed was to believe in..."
7859	"Uh, a seagull took my sailor hat."
7860	"You know Mom, I was thinking we could take Maggie downtown. ""The Jazz Hole"" is featuring a Dizzy Gillespie tribute band. Their trumpeter has the puffiest cheeks..."
7861	This yolk-separating camera-hog was supposed to call you and say happy birthday! From her show!
7862	Whatever. Either way is good...
7863	"It's your sons, George Bush Jr. and Jeb Bush. Come outside, Dad!"
7864	The police will catch you sooner or later.
7865	"Boy, someone's really gobbling up the juice, Sir."
7866	Don't you believe anything Homer says. His first word was a lie!
7867	"Oh, about that. Uh -- when I changed your oil, I may have drained your brake fluid. I didn't say anything 'cause I thought you'd be mad."
7868	"Oh, there's so many photo ops, but I already filled up my camera in the parking lot...parking lot C sign... the tram... a license plate from Canada..."
7869	"Ah, pre-modern man. If these wise warriors could speak, what would they tell us?"
7870	"Dad, don't encourage him."
7871	"The polite thing to do would've been to clean the shells first. Shoo, shoo!"
7872	They've broken every commandment except one!
7873	This is how I always stand when I tell adults what they should be doing.
7874	Take the kids out back.
7875	"Homer, can I see you in the kitchen?"
7876	How 'bout we take a family walk around the block?
7877	But we're not sleepy.
7878	There is for a Mega-Savings vacation. Chuck Garabedian says you can fly Mega-cheap if you don't care where you go.
7879	I just had a bad dream.
7880	"Nixon, Comet, Cupid... Donna Dixon."
7881	"I admit it. I did screw up, but I won't feel guilty until I can put a human face on this."
7882	"Mr. Burns, so glad you're here! Finally the party can get started!"
7883	So whoever it is who wrote that note wants to meet us here tonight?
7884	"Well, well. If it isn't the Tardy Boys and Nancy Clueless."
7885	No. Somehow a brief act of uncharacteristic generosity solved nothing.
7886	And anyone can be tooted?
7887	"Yet we at this power plant are doing this every hour of every day. Bloated inventories, outmoded production methods -- I can save this company millions of dollars a year. How? Through Jiko Kanri, the Japanese art of self-management. You see, in the West... the long term benefits more than offsetting the one-time cost... for a net savings of..."
7888	"Aw, let me get a picture of that."
7889	"Due to recent fluctuations in my judgment, and the once-in-a-lifetime mistake of trusting another human being, I am saddened to announce massive layoffs."
7890	"This'll teach that stupid chair. I'm on fire! Oh, I hope no one's drawing this. Ow!"
7891	"Aren't you proud of your big sister, Mr. Pinchy? Hmm? Hmm?"
7892	This goes on for 12 more minutes.
7893	"Oh, you mean Adam and Eve Simpson! Or as you may know them, Julius and Ethel Rosenberg."
7894	"Yes he does. He's on his way and when he gets here, we'll have ever so much fun! You'll see!"
7895	Okay. I'm not gonna give up. Solitude never hurt anyone. Emily Dickinson lived alone and she wrote some of the most beautiful poetry the world has ever known! And went crazy as a loon.
7896	I'm a freakin' Buddhist! A Buddhist!
7897	"Well, what are you going to do?"
7898	"Questions? Questions? Oh gee, my whole scheme down the... I mean, ask away."
7899	"Now, Maggie let's find a good game for us. Hm, ""Krusty's Kosher Karnival""...""Words With Enemies""...""Don't Burn the Toast!"", ""Lenny Dykstra's Prison Break,"" ooh, ""Pizza Clock""!"
7900	"If we stand together, we are strong!"
7901	"If you don't tell Mom what you did, I will."
7902	"Oh my God, Homie -- we're having a real conversation!"
7903	"That slugfest at the state fair was really a blessing. It gave us a chance to pursue solo projects. I returned to my first love, the legitimate theater."
7904	I bought these shoes from a hobo.
7905	"It's not you, Milhouse. I just don't plan to ever get married."
7906	"I got it halfway-- Oh, it went back."
7907	Ewww. It's not like in cartoons.
7908	I get to tamp the powder!
7909	You've certainly taken a shine to that magazine.
7910	"They're Controlling Our Minds With Flu Shots?! I knew it. Well kids, now aren't you glad we don't believe in inoculations?"
7911	I'm starting to regret it already.
7912	"Oh. Well, yes, that's what I meant, too. Well, tell you what. This afternoon, I'll take you to the beauty parlor and show you just how lovely you can be."
7913	Oh no. You are not taking the children.
7914	"I need a dress to wear for my son's big game. He's the star, I'm his mom, and he's my son."
7915	"WELL, I HOPE NEIL YOUNG WILL REMEMBER..."
7916	"Have some meat on a sword, Lisa. It'll cheer you up."
7917	I forgave you for accidentally killing my wife.
7918	"Yes, Kent. ""Hello, jerk. We may never find you, and we should probably all stop looking. But one thing's for sure: you do exist."""
7919	"Homer, when a man's biggest dreams include seconds on dessert, occasional snuggling, and sleeping till noon on weekends, no one man can destroy them."
7920	Robert Pinsky?! The former Poet Laureate?
7921	"Ka-boom! Blam! Oh, excuse me again, dear."
7922	Look at him. He's gonna do something. And you know it's gonna be good!
7923	Wait a minute. I thought you said I couldn't have this.
7924	"Rise and shine, everybody."
7925	But I'm a vegetarian!
7926	"Marge, that's what turns a mediocre voyage into a fantastic voyage."
7927	We've only brought in five dollars. And that came from Mr. Flanders buying back his own stuff.
7928	Sounds like someone's angling for a pony of her own.
7929	"Sorry, Dad. I was afraid the dragon wouldn't cough the moon back up."
7930	They have malls on land?
7931	"Okay... ""Pitch in the Negro Leagues,"" I can think of at least two problems with that... can't read that one, my thumb's over it..."
7932	"Now get up here, boy! We're gonna do the Super Bowl Shuffle."
7933	How am I supposed to know if I'm twenty feet away?
7934	It was symbolism. He was mad.
7935	"Well, that's not true! Everyone in this family is your friend."
7936	"Oh! Okay, I'm coming."
7937	Hm. Maybe we should air it out a little.
7938	I've got an idea: climb into my mouth.
7939	"Now Maggie, when you grow up you can suck your pacifier all you want."
7940	"I'd like to buy a mint condition ""Spider-Man Number One,"" please."
7941	"Sorry, guys. Marge and I are spending the weekend at a bed and breakfast."
7942	"Something wrong, officer?"
7943	"Take that, Ted Turner! In your face, founder of FaceBook!"
7944	We missed you so much!
7945	"Ooh, authentic American folk music, just like they play on N.P.R.!"
7946	Just like when I smell up the toilet.
7947	"Simpson, eh? Let's shut down this bowling scam right now."
7948	"Oh, well, when I was six, my father took me on a picnic. That was a gay old time. Oh-ho, I ate my share of wieners that day."
7949	"Lisa, here is as the French say, ""le fake diorama."" I'll create a diversion and you make the switch."
7950	"I can't do it, Mr. Burns."
7951	"You don't know, do you?"
7952	"Relax, Mom. I'll mold them into a shape you know and love."
7953	Hmm... this quaint artist community has gotten a little touristy.
7954	"Oh Lord, guide this cinder block..."
7955	"Shut up, Flanders, I need a favor. Would you mind watching Maggie for a while? It would only be until later."
7956	"Well, Annie, I think you know my answer."
7957	"Before we vote, I'd just like to point out in Sophie's Choice she saved the boy."
7958	"Ms. Dubinsky, can you please just tell us why you hate Krusty?"
7959	"That's it, I'm taking you off."
7960	"Well, I'll be damned."
7961	"Before you fix him... can you change one little thing? I'm embarrassed to ask this, but after we... snuggle, he always rolls over and goes to sleep and I'd rather..."
7962	"Well, maybe you'd get promoted if you worked a little harder."
7963	He is not my boyfriend!
7964	"That's exactly what it means. And Dondelinger took that life away from me. And the taking of a life is murder. And the punishment for murder is... well, it varies from state to state and by race... but I'm gonna find Dondelinger and tell him I know what he did last summer... twenty-two years ago... in the winter!"
7965	"Ah, looks like we put the kibosh on another two-bit telephone swindle, boys. Frankly, I would've expected better from Jimmy the Scumbag."
7966	Wipe me down and sign me up!
7967	"I'm sorry, honey. The waffle iron's in the shop."
7968	"Uh, you know. Smelling flowers. Such expensive flowers. Filled with remorse. Anyway, we gotta book a guest host."
7969	"So you want ventriloquism, do ya? All right. Watch this. Hello Alphonse, I've got a riddle for you. Why is a raven like a writing desk?"
7970	"So, you're married and you're looking for your first house, Mr. and Mrs..."
7971	Hm... needs more goat soul.
7972	"I, uh, I can also make very annoying noises."
7973	Where am I? This neighborhood is starting to look a little bit like... Sesame Street.
7974	"Oh, I wish I had that kind of relationship with my father... or my kids. Well, I guess it's up to me to take the first step."
7975	"Hey Marge, here's something that'll make you happy!"
7976	"Lurleen, they loved you."
7977	"Mom, Lisa's ruining football."
7978	"Simpson, I don't know how you're doing it, but you're outputting ten times the power our American plant ever did."
7979	Cool! He tried to kill me!
7980	"Be strong, Smithers. Be strong for the plant. She needs you."
7981	"Who's that guy?... What did that guy say when I said, ""Who's that guy?"""
7982	Can it really be Christmas when one of our parents is facing the German army?
7983	And that's when the CHUDs came at me.
7984	Those bullies are gonna kill me! Why am I doing this?
7985	"I taped over all my old episodes. Well, you know, I had a thing for Judge Judy, and blank tape was 3.99. What would you do?"
7986	Whew. Safe at last. Now I'll just turn around and confirm that safety.
7987	"Well, that didn't work."
7988	"Don't you think there's something weird going on here? We spent all day selecting fabric swatches, and then our guest speaker was ""Phil from Marketing""."
7989	"Come on, kids! We're gonna visit Grampa. Then we're gonna take the dog to the V-E-T..."
7990	"I don't want to censor myself, that's how creativity dies."
7991	Home sweet home. Now to watch some TV.
7992	Party! Party! Party! Party!
7993	I thought you were gonna let him come back!
7994	"Oh, I get it. You're all gonna try to convince me that my life is great just like it is, right?"
7995	Fine. I'm going for a walk.
7996	"Hey, how ya doin'? I'm Homer. My wife invented a gym for ""regular"" women."
7997	Way over. We gotta save that poor girl. Anyone know how we get home?
7998	"All right, ""Thinks Too Much,"" it shall be so."
7999	I bet you could have a lot of fun with this. Why don't you go show your father?
8000	"He's gettin' away! You blew it, Marge!"
8001	Terrific. Now call Lindsay Naegle.
8002	It's how the pros do it.
8003	And the power of that forbidden smooch made them love each other forever.
8004	"One for ""Itchy and Scratchy""."
8005	I've never seen the baby get tired of it before the adult.
8006	Can't murder now. Eating.
8007	"Aw boy, I feel for ya. Nobody likes to be rejected, and it never gets easier, until you can drink. Because then you can express your unfiltered feelings by drunk dialing."
8008	Ay carumba! Somebody's actually on your side!
8009	"Okay, now let's pretend that we're going for a drive."
8010	Homer! You're trying to talk us into moving to this place.
8011	THE ALL-MIGHTY DOLLAR?!!
8012	"Bart, this is a big day for you. Why don't you eat something a little more nutritious?"
8013	"I know, ranch dressing."
8014	"I couldn't find Maggie's brand, but I got every other kind I could find. How about ""Syntho-Nip?"""
8015	"Um, I don't think you want to look in there, sir."
8016	I'm only three months younger than you.
8017	"Vibrate for me, footstool."
8018	Your mother dragged us both to that God-forsaken lovefest...
8019	"Uh... I love ya, Mom!"
8020	You could fake your own death...
8021	"Yes'm. Anima Patri, et Filio, et Spiritui Sancto..."
8022	I LIKE TO WALK DOWN THE AVENUE / BUST A MOVE WITH DISCO STU...
8023	It's still a great honor!
8024	"Bart, it's still history."
8025	You were given six weeks to live. And you've outlived it! I think what kept you alive was that for once in your life you were helping other people.
8026	Why do you have to question everything I do?!!
8027	"Which chapter should we skip to: ""Meet Danny Roman,"" ""Trouble Brewing,"" ""Off the Case,"" ""My Baby's In There,"" ""Enter Niebaum,"" ""Take The Shot,"" ""Sabian's Choice,"" ""Check and Mate,"" ""Friends At Last,"" ""Closing Credits..."""
8028	"Hey, everybody! Look, I'm the funniest guy in the world!"
8029	"All right, Son. We'll all go -- first class!"
8030	"Lisa, your date's here!"
8031	"I wouldn't bother him, honey. He's making some kind of model for a contest. He says it's really high-tech stuff that we wouldn't understand."
8032	Oh man. Who'd think the first day of Lent would be such a bummer?
8033	Well I don't like it.
8034	"You all know me. I've kept the streets safe for you and your children. I've tricked or treated at many of your houses. Last year I was Jar Jar Binks. Now, who will stand and fight with me?"
8035	"Hey, I found a bullet."
8036	"Fort. That's build a ""fort."""
8037	"Capital City? You can't move that far, you're my best friend. What's your Mom making? I'll match it!"
8038	Bup-up-up! Safety locks!
8039	That doesn't matter. The important thing is we won.
8040	I won the science fair! I get to go to Chicago!
8041	My tummy really hurts.
8042	"Dad, when did you record an album?"
8043	The Springfield River!
8044	That medicine's not for you.
8045	"Don't worry, I make six of those a year."
8046	"Oh, Marge, there's so many things I want to yell to you!"
8047	"We hit the jackpot, here! White gold! Texas tea... sweetener."
8048	"Please, Dad, I'll be fine."
8049	"Hey, what's Lucky hooked up to?"
8050	You're a useless old man! Name one thing you do for this family.
8051	"Oh my God, you look just like your dad!"
8052	"Being a jerk, minus a million points."
8053	"Yo, Dad, can I have a sip of your beer?"
8054	"Thank you, and goodbye."
8055	"Uh, I'm a little short this week. Could I just pay you five dollars to keep out Hardee's?"
8056	Ow! That Bullet went in.
8057	"I'm not the only one, Homeboy."
8058	"While you're singing and dancing, somewhere out there Ronaldo is waiting to be found."
8059	"Take a hike boss, I'm running things now."
8060	Mrs. Bouvier! Mrs. Bouvier!
8061	Why you little... He did that on purpose!
8062	Is there a chance for advancement?
8063	All our friends are like that!
8064	"That's not my Uncle Lou, and this man's not dead."
8065	Con: You're endangering your health.
8066	"Okay, everybody. Let's see some big smiles."
8067	Where'd everybody go?
8068	"Oh, your father traded our tools for M&M's again. Ah, the heck with it."
8069	Full coverage... hmm...
8070	You're right. Gimme a minute. Hmmm.
8071	They printed my photo of our gang!
8072	So we're right back where we used to be.
8073	Don't hurt me! Here's my wallet.
8074	Christmas is my busy season. Sold three pairs of scissors this month! Two came back.
8075	"No, because you'll never do any better. You lucky bum! The fish jumped right in the boat. All you gotta do is whack her with the oar."
8076	"Apu, I'm returning a yogurt I wasn't a hundred per cent satisfied with."
8077	I guess I should give this back to you.
8078	"Ohhh, thank God. Thank God. Thank God."
8079	"When Lorne asked me to host this show, I said Lorne, why me? I mean, I did just star in my first movie with Marvin Hagler and Tovah Borgnine. Yeah! Anyway. We got a great show for you. Well actually, the last half hour is a real garbage dump. Uh... we'll be right back."
8080	EVERYBODY HATES THAT STUPID JERK!
8081	"Dad, those kids aren't dumb. This show just perpetuates the stereotype that all yokels are hicks!"
8082	I'm not sure that we can afford...
8083	That's a good idea. Let's go out for some frosty swirls.
8084	Maybe we should move to a larger community.
8085	"Oh, look. Bart's all alone. Maybe I should keep him company, at least for a little while."
8086	The year was sixteen twenty...
8087	And that sends me into a shame spiral.
8088	Chicks on the bench...
8089	Why did you let that loser into our home?
8090	"This is the real world? Hallelujah, I'm still alive! Ha-ha! And I'll appreciate every moment, except the ones that aren't as good as they used to be, which is all of them. Ooh... someone kill me."
8091	"Hey, smooth move, Flanders!"
8092	"Operator, get me Thailand. T...i... and so on."
8093	"Fine. We're all going to stay here with the comic book. It'll be like a sleep-over. Yeah, a sleep-over. That's what pals do, right? Real friendly-like."
8094	"Like all childless couples, they troll the beaches waiting for the egg-layers to wander off from their young."
8095	"Lisa, don't spoil our fun!"
8096	"Dr. Hibbert, Lisa needs a. You! Homewrecker!"
8097	"Thanks... uh... Say, are you guys crooks?"
8098	"Goodbye forever, multiplication!"
8099	"Oh, Ned! I'm so sorry!"
8100	"Yeah, I meant to, I've just been sooo busy. My schedule has been all like ."
8101	"The National Grammar Rodeo! I wish I were going. Oh, wait, wait -- I mean, I wish I was going. Is that right, Bart?"
8102	I'm in no condition to drive. Wait -- I shouldn't listen to myself. I'm drunk.
8103	"I know. We had a fight, we were both tempted... we're human. The important thing is, we love each other."
8104	"I know, I know. Don't serve garlic... don't stab your guest in the heart with a wooden stake... don't ask him if he knows Frankenstein. It's racist somehow."
8105	"I'll teach you how to use a phone, you boob!"
8106	Drink the drink that I have made.
8107	"Oh, that's just a paranoid fantasy."
8108	Welcome to the American dream: a billionaire using public funds to construct a private playground for the rich and powerful.
8109	What could come between two bestest buddies like us?
8110	I was thinking something more artistic. Something musical. You could take advantage of a fantastic musician living right here!
8111	Fine! I can have a great time all by myself!
8112	"Ohh, anything, sweetheart."
8113	"Man, who comes up with this stuff?"
8114	"All right, the coast is clear."
8115	"Let's see now... ""Kill spiders?"" We don't have spiders."
8116	Please the hobo. Please the hobo. Please the hobo.
8117	"... and the policeman on the other end of the phone said, ""We have traced the call. It's coming from the floor below you. Get out of the house!"" But it was too late. End of story."
8118	Mufft a been a co-in-fa-dince.
8119	"Come on, Marge -- all sports have their lovable clowns: John Rocker, O.J. Simpson, Dorf..."
8120	Rainbows... tank tops... empowerment... This is the Gay Pride Parade! Woo hoo!
8121	"Don't listen to him, sir. You've got an enchanting musk."
8122	"Yeah, yeah, yeah just give me the serum."
8123	"Heel? Oh no, tell me you are not trying to be like Grampa!"
8124	"I go to see those other guys, we blow this junk up, once again Mom decides that they're a bad influence on me, and she stops seeing those women who make her so happy."
8125	"Well, it's about time somebody reach out to me."
8126	"Hey, everyone, I'm back! Great to see ya! Nice seein' ya!"
8127	It's Xena! She's been kidnapped! Come on!
8128	You had a quadruple bypass. You nearly died. Don't you remember?
8129	"Uh, the Prince of Darkness, sir. He's your eleven o'clock."
8130	"Don't worry, the new football season is only seven months away."
8131	"Oh, this is so confusing. I'd like a brief recess."
8132	Now there's nothing to do now but sit back and wait for the kudos to roll in.
8133	Oh great! Here comes the haggling!
8134	"Well, better get home. The delightfulness ended hours ago."
8135	"That's right, money. Your money's happiness is all that moneys."
8136	Bart! Bart! What are you doing?! We've got to get out of here!
8137	"I don't hand out candy, you son of a Gritch."
8138	What are the Beatles?
8139	"You should hang with us sometime, Lis."
8140	"Okay, here goes. Bart, I have something for you!"
8141	Dad?? The panda was you?
8142	I fooled you. So long suckers. Hee hee hee.
8143	Don't you hate pants?
8144	Michael Jackson just told me to shut up!
8145	MY MOUSTACHE / IS BRISTLY / MY LETTERS / ARE EPISTLY / AND I DON'T WANNA / MISLEAD YOU / I LIKE TO HUG AND KISSLY--
8146	"Cool! Way to adapt, little guy."
8147	"Aw, don't cry, meat pie. Things worked out pretty well for Virgil in the end."
8148	"Six cups, please. And put it on my tab."
8149	"Homer Simpson, report for much worse duties."
8150	Stop eating our tickets!
8151	It's Grampa. And it sounds like he's gotten into the horseradish again.
8152	Berry-peach?! That's my favorite!
8153	The Flanders are having a beef-a-thon! Incredible Ned-ibles! Maude-acious vittles!.
8154	I'll just stick this in your apology card drawer.
8155	"Mom, I'm really sorry."
8156	Proceed to the page with the butterfly bookmark as I cuddle up with Madame Bunny.
8157	Nooo! I wrote a phone number in there!
8158	Yes! That's the kind of moxie I'm looking for. You're hired!
8159	That one means good vittles...
8160	"Grampa, you're not dead."
8161	"Quit following me, you coward!"
8162	"Dad, that's a sports bra."
8163	Wouldn't be the first time.
8164	"H-Heyy, let me off this thing."
8165	I've really enjoyed paying you to yell at me and say I suck. But it's no use -- I'm a hopeless loser and always will be.
8166	"Sir, your cheeks are ruddy! Did you eat a sugar cube while I wasn't watching?"
8167	"Oh, I get it. I'm on to you."
8168	And there's that awful script from The Cable Guy!
8169	How many times can you laugh at that cat getting hit by the moon?
8170	"Boy, I really feel like a Viking in this thing."
8171	"That's some nice flutin', boy."
8172	"Oh no, Rosie O'Donnell."
8173	"Well, run for the hills, Ma Barker, before I call the Feds."
8174	Why are you so cruel?
8175	The Simpsons have entered the forest.
8176	"Naw, he's cool. He's gonna think this is hilarious."
8177	"Now you listen to me -- I don't like you. I never liked you, and the only reason I gave you that stupid valentine is `cause nobody else would!"
8178	"How 'bout it, Homer? Will you teach me the secret of your intoxicating lust for life?"
8179	Sounds like the Doomsday Whistle. Ain't been blown for nigh on to three years.
8180	I'll join! I'm filled with piss and vinegar. At first I was just filled with vinegar...
8181	You're all gonna die in a pointless war!
8182	"So if we were in school this week, what do you think we'd be learning?"
8183	"Make my daughter cry, will ya! Eat syrup, jerk!"
8184	"Uh, I don't think so."
8185	"Oh, you're so right. I guess I should be more concerned with Bart's safety than covering my own butt. And maybe I'm talking like this because I can't stop. Help me, Lisa! I have serious mental problems!"
8186	No. They must have seen you.
8187	"No, Dad, no. My point is you have to do something big and daring."
8188	"Uh, I'm here to check in for the three o'clock."
8189	The people being whipped!
8190	"Yeah, can you see out of it? Does it change colors when you're ticked off?"
8191	"Chubby, chunky, blobbo, slobbo, Fat Bastard, Michelin Man, Stay-puft, chumbawamba, It is balloon!, Papa GrandÃ©, Augustus Gloop, Beached Whale, Big Boned, Wisconsin Skinny, Butterball, Dumptruck, Jelly Belly, Pudgy Wudgy, Lard Ass, Blubberino, Buddha Belly, Hurry Eat Tubman, One Ton Soup, Blob Saget, Chub Hub, Calvin Cool Whip, Manfred Manboobs, 21 Lump Street, Walking Before Picture, Fatso, Harvey Milk Chocolate, Obese Want Cannoli, Mahatma Gumbo, Salvador Deli, Elmer Pantry, K.F.C. And The Sponge Cake Band, Snackie Onassis... The Foodie Blues, Hoagie Carmichael and Wide Load."
8192	"You see, that's what I'm saying."
8193	What?! How do you know about things like that?
8194	So much homework... childhood slipping away...
8195	Hmm. My career has kinda lost momentum...
8196	"What does that mean, exactly?"
8197	"So, I gotta know... do you guys forgive me?"
8198	I heard a noise outside and thought it might be Homer.
8199	Those are past-due bills.
8200	"Honey, this sounds like a noble experiment, but like prohibition, it will end in a hail of bullets."
8201	"Yeah, and the great prices at that new rib joint were the surprise of the evening."
8202	Give me back my thumb!
8203	"Ooo, sexy drinks, adult board games..."
8204	"Don't worry, there's plenty for all of you! Now who's laughing? Huh? Huh? Me! I'm laughing!"
8205	Time to get my mischief on!
8206	Lobsters need salt water.
8207	"Good. Now, the police car."
8208	"Hey, why'd you lock the door? We're still inside!"
8209	And treated like I deserve.
8210	Why would you want to banish us from Springfield?
8211	"Man, you've got an awesome voice."
8212	"Well, it's just about what we need to pay for our fire damage."
8213	The only gas is coming from Lisa's butt!
8214	I'll just keep cutting till I hit something solid.
8215	He taught us how to live a Burt Reynolds lifestyle on a Mac Davis income. We've already got tickets for his next seminar.
8216	"Well, some general-interest magazines would be nice."
8217	"Hey, what gives? Where are all the rock stars?"
8218	I'm just trying to party with you guys.
8219	"Marge, this is crazy!"
8220	But somehow our anniversaries didn't get better than that first one on the train.
8221	"Son, from now on, I'm eating all my meals here at school -- with you!"
8222	What the--? You're alive!... and... buck nekkid.
8223	"I've suffered as much as anyone at the paws of this dog. But when I look into his vacant brown eyes, I just can't bear to let him go. I'm sure Mom agrees with me."
8224	"Judge, jury, and executioner all rolled into one, you are."
8225	The holes were drilled for your fingers.
8226	"I'm not gonna stand for this. I'm gonna call the newspapers, the TV stations, the gas stations, everybody."
8227	"Why do you mock me, oh Lord?"
8228	"Just Bart will be fine, sir."
8229	"Ah, ""heck,"" ""darn"" -- I don't think so."
8230	"Whaddya say we roll on the grass, son?"
8231	"Uh, they're just snowmen, Mr. Burns."
8232	"Bart, it's past your bedtime."
8233	"Bart, I need that shirt. I'll trade you Puppy Goo Goo for it."
8234	Well then there won't be any sex!
8235	With eight years of scrupulous honesty.
8236	"You're a good friend, Bart."
8237	"Now, I'd like to introduce you to your new manager. You'll find his integrity and dedication make him untouchable."
8238	"Mr. Burns, why'd you come to see me?"
8239	The town of Springfield was born on that day. And to mark that sweet moment our people planted this lemon tree. Lemons being the sweetest fruit available at the time.
8240	You leave those boys alone!
8241	"Uh, that was a lovely song. It really got to me."
8242	Well... this could be fun. Let's watch it.
8243	"That's it, boy! You're going to bed without supper!"
8244	"Bart, you're not helping."
8245	Then why did you say it?
8246	And by the Sacred Parchment I swear that if I reveal the secrets of the Stonecutters may my stomach become bloated and my head be plucked of all but three hairs.
8247	...it means the signal is a fake.
8248	Bleeding Gums was my hero and I never got to tell him how I felt.
8249	"Here you go, Bart. It's a long shot, but, that's all I can do without learning ancient Hebrew."
8250	"Okay, but you promised me moe money."
8251	I really hope we're not spoiling them.
8252	"Aw, Moe, Moe, Moe, dry those beady little eyes. Your buddy Homer'll get you back on your feet."
8253	"But if you quit, it'll be like an expert knot-tier quitting a knot-tying contest right in the middle of tying a knot!"
8254	"But now, I want to follow in your footsteps."
8255	Even the Ralph of this school speaks French!
8256	What does that mean? You're sharpening it?
8257	Did you talk about me in therapy today?
8258	Now I am never eating that broccoli.
8259	Poison! What should I do? What should I do? Tell me quick!
8260	"Our contestants will drop out of my nose and blurp into a tub of refried beans. From there, they'll stumble down a sluice of rich, eggy bearnaise sauce. How can we afford it? It's rancid!"
8261	Just burn that plant right now and end this madness.
8262	"Mom, my sling shot doesn't fit in these pockets. And these shorts leave nothing to the imagination. These uniforms suck!"
8263	"I'll tell you when you're dead, Grampa."
8264	I was really looking forward to it.
8265	"Hey! I'm not a ""Time Burglar!"""
8266	Yeah. That should be us covered with blood!
8267	"Hey, that's not fair! I wanna be a carny, too! Can I, mister? Huh? Can I? Please?"
8268	"You have to offer people something: a joke, an opinion, an idea..."
8269	I gotta barf! Where's the bathroom?!
8270	"Well, I can't take that rattlesnake out of his mailbox now, now can I?"
8271	"From this day forward, I am an inventor!"
8272	Put it all on forty-one. I've got a feeling about that number.
8273	And I want to let you!!
8274	"Here are your messages: ""You have 30 minutes to move your car,"" ""You have 10 minutes,"" ""Your car has been impounded,"" ""Your car has been crushed into a cube,"" ""You have 30 minutes to move your cube."""
8275	I'm tired of being a corporate shill.
8276	"I raise a million dollars... and to sweeten the pot, my assistant, Smithers."
8277	"Hey baby, banned forever doesn't mean you can't go back sometimes."
8278	"Wait. If I could only stay on the air, I'd have a hundred percent of the audience. Think of the ratings."
8279	"I'm stealing five Segways at once! And speaking of segues, I'm off to my next morally questionable activity!"
8280	"He's going to need a... you know, ""protection."""
8281	"Well, you might as well give me a ride home now!"
8282	"Ah, here's a chance to earn my keep. I will go out and get these items from the food jobber."
8283	"Absolutely. We're talking about Lisa, right?"
8284	"The guy's so high, he doesn't even know that's Dave."
8285	There's only one person in the world who can tell you what to do. And that person is right here!
8286	I don't think we should be down here.
8287	"Wow, I'm surprised you guys know so much about a sport."
8288	"Huh? Wait a minute, this doesn't look like Oslo. Where are the wood-stave churches? Historic Akershus Fortress?"
8289	I'm sick of him already.
8290	Yeah. So what do you call this stuff?
8291	"Well, we're gonna turn this change into change for the better!"
8292	"Hey, whatcha packin', Simpson?"
8293	"Frankly, no. Lisa kind of took care of herself. Our oldest, Bart, was such a handful."
8294	Look what Mbali gave me.
8295	"Aw, so that's what's been wrong with the little fella. He misses casual sex."
8296	What's good as new? Who's talking?
8297	"Don't worry. If even half of your husband is out here, Officer Scraps'll find him."
8298	"Hello. Hello. I'm-I'm Marge Simpson. And I'm here to talk about a-a-a wonderful, beautiful thing--"
8299	"Hey, give me some of that."
8300	"That's right. And I implore you to move your concert to our town. Don't play Olde Springfield, or as it is sometimes known, Sun City."
8301	And I have a card that can take us anywhere they go.
8302	"All right. I've sat through mercy and I've sat through forgiveness. Finally, we get to the good stuff."
8303	"Dearest Diary, today I am the happiest girl in Springfield--"
8304	You guys are nuts. All you can do is eat and sleep and mate and roll around in your own filth and mate and eat... where do I sign up?
8305	"Oh, I just naturally assumed."
8306	...Fifteen dollars to infect your kids!
8307	"Now, Homer, don't worry. All I need to do is find Mr. Burns' inner beauty."
8308	MISS LUCY HAD A STEAMBOAT / THE STEAMBOAT HAD A BELL...
8309	"Show's over, Shakespeare!"
8310	"Oh, how to explain this to a child... Hm... Future Daddy needs to double-kill these corpses so they won't come back as zombies, and-- Get 'im!"
8311	"You know, your movie's not all bad. If you cut out the stuff that didn't work, it would make a great short film."
8312	"Oh. Oh, wow, lucky thing we landed on this bubble wrap."
8313	"Yeah, they won't learn anything about apples today."
8314	"Mr. Musk, before you go, is there anything you could do to give a little girl hope that the world of the future won't be as grim as all our current movies forecast?"
8315	"Homer, your father's dead!"
8316	Then what are you dressed like that for?
8317	Oooh... entertainment.
8318	Temperance Barrows stared at the sea like a dog stares at a ham...
8319	"Mom, thanks to you, this box sucker didn't beat me up!"
8320	"Wow, I've created something incredibly popular!"
8321	"A troll, that's it! Our book could be about an orphan troll!"
8322	It seems to be stuck. Bad baby! Bad Maggie!
8323	"How could you, Krusty? I'd never lend my name to an inferior product."
8324	"Quit it! Knock it off! Stop it! Dad, this isn't funny!"
8325	"There, there, Bart. You're just a late bloomer."
8326	"All right, Herb, I'll lend you the two thousand bucks. But you have to forgive me and treat me like a brother."
8327	Is there anything you need?
8328	Huh? This one didn't make me feel anything.
8329	I got out of school because I told them I was mangled in a car wreck.
8330	This store makes me feel even worse about myself.
8331	He's just faking it to get out of jail! He's a maniac!
8332	One of the wheels broke off my chair today. But I didn't make a movie about it.
8333	"Wednesday we did ""Mame."""
8334	I'm sure he doesn't do it deliberately.
8335	"I know. It's times like this that I'm thankful Dad has little to no interest in almost everything I do. Bart, I think I can help you."
8336	Hmm. That looks entertaining.
8337	Gotcha! It's April Fool's for two more minutes!
8338	"Marge, what were you thinking?"
8339	"Oh, Apu! It's beautiful!"
8340	"Uh, Mecca? Well, let's..."
8341	"Get a picture of a restaurant check with no tip, put it online, say it was him. Kaboom, he's finished!"
8342	"Hmm, I guess Bart's not to blame. He's lucky too, because it's spankin' season and I've got a hankerin' for some spankerin'."
8343	"Sure. Sock it to me, baby."
8344	"Sing us a song, Shary Bobbins."
8345	"He's either a fifty foot prehistoric ape, or a tourist trap concocted by the ape island jaycees. Either way, we're going ashore."
8346	You were Ronnie to his Nancy!
8347	Woulda got an A but I was sick!
8348	I'm looking for Homer Simpson.
8349	"My name is Mary. I'm 45, heavy and willing to settle for less."
8350	"I paid your bail, honey. You're free to go."
8351	Wondered where that was.
8352	Whoa. Maybe some punk kid will shoot me to get into a gang.
8353	Hugh should take it easy because of his fall.
8354	"Well, it seems real to me."
8355	That hollow mountain in Nevada that was supposed to hold a million years of nuclear waste is full.
8356	"C'mon, people. The Prison Nutcracker Suite is one week away. And I don't see five sugarplums. I see five guys who don't know their moves and don't seem to care. There, I said it."
8357	"What are you on, pal?"
8358	"Mom, stop! Stop! Stop! I'm sorry!"
8359	For knocking Mr. Burns out a third story window.
8360	"And if anything happens to me, I want you bullies to take care of my boy."
8361	You can't resist smoking in the house any more than I can resist drinking in the car.
8362	"Face the facts, has-been. This man is the comic book guy our town deserves!"
8363	"Besides, it's mine. Yoink!"
8364	You are cruel but fair.
8365	"Don't forget the leg protectors, sir."
8366	"Okay, you're new to our school, so here's the deal: we call Skinner, ""Skin-rash,"" Mr. Wiener is ""Mr. Whiner,"" and Groundskeeper Willie, ""Grounds-creeper Stupid."""
8367	"And when I come back, I want a foot rub."
8368	"A+? You don't think much of me, do you boy?"
8369	"And look over there, Moe."
8370	Could I please hear it in a sentence?
8371	Maybe. But I still love them. And I don't think you understand that.
8372	"Guys, I am not cursed!"
8373	"Well, he just goes... Ohhh"
8374	Yeah. I missed her like five times.
8375	"It was, Marge. Admit it."
8376	"Time for bed, sweetie."
8377	"That, too. He also invented the phonograph, the microphone, and the electric car."
8378	"Wait, you can't hate me. I'm your better! Your better!"
8379	Look at how disciplined they are. They're just like the Terra Cotta Warriors of Xian.
8380	"It's our last family dinner for six weeks, but I promised myself I wouldn't cry."
8381	"Hey... we do! Oh, Marge!"
8382	The family looks good.
8383	No! I'm not done yet.
8384	"Now, it's my turn to roll the dice! Wanna kiss them for me?"
8385	Look at them. Smug and secure in their finery. Mocking us.
8386	"Well, Homer, looks like we're boat buddies, huh? Want me to Zinc your sniffer?"
8387	They're spying on me?! That's horrible!
8388	Give something back? Boo! Get a haircut!
8389	"Wow, it glows in the dark."
8390	A piece! Now let's see where this goes.
8391	"That is so cool. All right, you can come."
8392	"Panic not, fellow Springfielders!"
8393	What? Can't I get a cup of coffee without doing a monkey dance for you freaks?
8394	"Homer, why are they saying you're going to fight Drederick Tatum?"
8395	"Well, I'm off to work."
8396	Congratulations. You're officially a sociopath.
8397	I always wondered if there was a god. And now I know. There is. And it's me.
8398	"Oh, Dad. You sold your soul."
8399	"Okay, boy, I want you to keep this exercise thing under your hat. That way I won't be embarrassed if I fail."
8400	Creator of Marvel Comics?!
8401	"Oh, Lisa has excellent hearing. Once when she was three, I was quietly sobbing in the closet and she found me!"
8402	"Cheer up, Toot-Toot. Have some of my ice cream."
8403	"That's impossible! Smithers, didn't we move this plant to China?"
8404	Point of order: I didn't lose all the money. There was enough left for this cowbell.
8405	"Homie, no! It's not street legal!"
8406	"Okay, they bought it."
8407	"Five, four, three, two, one, lift-off!"
8408	"Flanders, I'm gonna do something I shoulda done a long time ago."
8409	What are you guys in for?
8410	"Not so fast, Simpson. This foul business was all your fault."
8411	"Yes, I gotta work hard, honey. Daddy made a lot of crazy promises."
8412	"Well, kids, that's all the time we have for today."
8413	And you didn't think I'd make any money. I found a dollar while I was waiting for the bus.
8414	They warned me Satan would be attractive. Let's go.
8415	You're pretty uptight for a naked chick. You know what would loosen you up? A little fruit.
8416	I'm stronger than I've ever been! I don't have to go back inside. I'm not afraid!
8417	But then we're stuck with gorillas!
8418	Who wants to see their sexy new daddy?
8419	Meet me in the bathroom.
8420	"The Inventor I Admire, by Bart Simpson. The inventor I admire is, not a rich man, or a famous man, or even a smart man. He's my father, Homer Simpson, creator of... the ""Flaming Homer""!"
8421	"... and finally, Moe's Tavern has contributed a coupon as their way of saying ""Welcome to Springfield."""
8422	"Homie, this might be a clue! What's in that coffin could be behind your nighttime oopsies!"
8423	"Wow Mom, great red dress!"
8424	Can we at least drink beer or something?
8425	"As Tolstoy said in ""Quotable Notables,"" ""Give me learning, sir, and you may keep your black bread."""
8426	It's the prettiest boy in Springfield... Bart Simpson!
8427	Shred them in the wood chipper and use the rags to wax my car.
8428	"Homer, you've been out all night! And you look like you've accepted someone as your personal something. Were you at that Catholic Church?!"
8429	"Smithers, I'm missing the fun!"
8430	"No, I'm not. And here's a picture that proves it."
8431	"Yeah, quit stalling, Marge. We want our reward."
8432	"Huh, that's weird, my armpits are gettin' wet."
8433	"Well, that's good too, I guess."
8434	"Don't blame us, Dad. The celebrities are the ones who canned you."
8435	"I admit it's kind of cute, but it'll never take the place of Malibu Stacy."
8436	"Ooh, it's so late. You kids have to go to bed."
8437	Let's just agree that the commercialization of Christmas is at best a mixed blessing.
8438	"Hey! What's wrong with this neighborhood? Big shot. Too good to buy a house here, Snobby?"
8439	"Hm, I'm gonna need a bigger drill."
8440	"Oh, my. I've been so unfair to Becky. Maybe I am insane. I mean, I am talking to myself."
8441	Why... do... I... suck?
8442	"And when he tried to steal our sunlight, he crossed that line between everyday villainy and cartoonish super-villainy."
8443	"Homer, wake up. There's no answer at home."
8444	"You can't bet on my kids. This is America, pal!"
8445	"Artie, thank you for doing the right thing. Eventually."
8446	"Oh, no. He can't mean that."
8447	"I've got three bathrooms, don't I? Next."
8448	"Hey, what's this? ""Marge's Memory Chest."""
8449	SO I THREW YOU A FANCY BANQUET / AND NOW YOU CAN'T STAY MAD / HOW 'BOUT A MAKE-UP SNUGGLE? / IT WOULD BE SO RAD.
8450	"No way a bull is gonna miss a target that big, man."
8451	"Oh, did you say a million? I'm... I'm sorry, my mind was elsewhere. I thought you would start with a small amount, then we would bait each other and... well, you know how it goes. Yes... certainly, a million will be fine."
8452	"Okay boys, here's a loony law from nineteen eleven: ""Five kicks of the same can shall be considered illegally transporting litter."""
8453	Yes. And it's a big one. Remember?
8454	It's real. I can show you!
8455	"If you win, Ovenfresh Industries will make you the new face of Auntie Ovenfresh."
8456	We've gotta find someplace no one will ever go. Hel-lo!
8457	OLD MCDONALD HAD A FARM / EE-I-EE-I-O / AND ON THIS FARM HE HAD A CHICK / SWINGINGEST CHICK I KNOW / WITH A WIGGLE WIGGLE HERE AND A WIGGLE WIGGLE THERE...
8458	"Heh, heh, heh. Go ahead. Try and grab some flab. Go on. Ju--"
8459	"Homer Simpson! Well, if that don't put the ""dink"" in co-inky-dink."
8460	"Want some more, do ya? Well, sure! Heck, it's not my job to talk people outta killin' themselves..."
8461	I know where Bob's taking Bart!
8462	"I don't understand what's so great about these state of the art, solar-powered, computo-glasses."
8463	"Homer, it's two a.m.! What happened?"
8464	"Yeah, that'll happen."
8465	"Oh, Lisa. Honey, it's okay. You're a Buddhist, so you know your cats are now reincarnated as a higher form of life."
8466	The sum of the square roots of any two sides of an isosceles triangle is equal to the square root of the remaining sides.
8467	"Oh, I don't get the job, do I? Well, boo-hoo, I don't get to be a cartoon dog."
8468	No! The Smithsonian Traveling Exhibit.
8469	"Well, no, no... no. I guess not."
8470	What? They've given you thousands of
8471	"Look, if you ignore me and I die, you'd get in a lot of trouble."
8472	Perhaps I may be of help.
8473	"Homer, you can't just keep hanging out with these Colobus monkeys. Somebody's gonna get parasites."
8474	I think it's terrible. A man opens his heart and you make fun of him.
8475	"So, which of you wants to be the sliced haddock in a geezer sandwich?"
8476	"No. You don't understand, Nelson. A kiss doesn't mean anything if it's dishonest."
8477	Not even a little one?
8478	"Homer! The bad news, ladies, is we already have wives."
8479	You've really done it this time.
8480	Martin! I've made a major discovery!
8481	We'll never sell these. Birds won't even use them in their nests.
8482	"This is my test subject, Francine."
8483	"Now, folks, nothin' spells fun like rhinestones on a dungaree jacket!"
8484	"Sorry, son, but we're going to be very busy. Mel's movie really stinks."
8485	"Oh, Happy Anniversary, Marge."
8486	I wanted to surprise you with a kicky summer 'do. How many husbands would do that for their wives?
8487	"Mom, Dad... I want to change schools!"
8488	"Look at me, Bart! I'm driving!"
8489	What? I've gotta be in the same class as her?
8490	"Uhhh, could we hear another tall tale?"
8491	Yes indeedilly-doodily.
8492	"I dreamed about her again last night, Smithers. You know that dream where you're in bed and they fly in through the window?"
8493	Is this your suggestion?
8494	"She's not plain, she's beautiful!"
8495	"Bart, I do so much for you and yet you have disappointed me on every one of my birthdays. I've made things for you. But you've lost or broken them in hours... but, okay, we'll forget all..."
8496	"Well, don't worry. There are still plenty of fish in the sea. Right, Homer?"
8497	"So she said that's not my ""in box"" and he said that's not the Johnson Report!"
8498	You went to Woodstock?
8499	"Marge, the only thing going on down there was a lot of male bonding."
8500	The hamster has learned a valuable lesson. Beware the hand of man.
8501	CompuGlobal HyperMegaNet. Junior Vice President Homer Simpson speaking. How may I direct your call?
8502	"Pays for itself after the 16th visit. You know, most people don't know the difference between apple cider and apple juice. But I do. Now here's a little trick to help you remember..."
8503	"So, how you doin', Willie?"
8504	"Now then, I'm looking for a suitable young, male heir to leave my fortune to when I pass away. My vast, vast, vast fortune. Vast."
8505	"Son, I know you meant well, but that wasn't the right thing to do."
8506	"No, I'm not. I'm teaching you about rock music."
8507	"Sorry, Burns. No deal."
8508	"Homer, come quick! Bart's quit his tutoring job and joined a violence-gang!"
8509	The man at the stand said it was a record!
8510	And I'm not done yet. You know that little ball you put on the aerial so you can find your car in a parking lot? That should be on every car.
8511	"Look at this: Springfield Elementary's rating is so low, it's more than two standard deviations below the norm."
8512	"Marge, we can't be too careful. There are thieves everywhere, and I'm not talking about the small, forgivable stuff."
8513	"Marge, you awake? Marge?"
8514	Now you kids be good while mother's in prison.
8515	"No, not you. I'm talking to the boy. Keep your head down. Follow through..."
8516	I was never sure about this marriage.
8517	"Well, I'll fix that. I'm goin' on the bender to end all benders!"
8518	"Uh-oh. You've gotta help me, Bart."
8519	"Oh, please, continue..."
8520	"Well, what are we waiting for?"
8521	Enough chitchat. Time for operation dog dump.
8522	"Santa's Little Helper would be an awesome police dog! Can he, Dad? Can he?"
8523	Great! Put it on number twenty.
8524	"And let me tell you, a towel rack will not support your weight."
8525	What's your favorite radio station?
8526	Um... say... is there anything I can do to avoid coming back here?
8527	Hey! I've spent a lifetime making people happy.
8528	Finally. Can we go now?
8529	I think he's building to something.
8530	I think you know the answer to that.
8531	Can I have a clean glass?
8532	"Now they're all excellent choices, so simply pick the white male candidate you prefer and we'll elect him."
8533	"Yes Dad, I solemnly swear I will not tell another living soul... No, not even Milhouse."
8534	"Hmm... A bushel of apples packed in each bar, plus a secret ingredient that unleashes the awesome power of apples. Wow."
8535	You're right. We could use this for witchcraft.
8536	Could we make our own movies and enter them?
8537	"You've managed to survive on a craphole island that looks like the moon and smells like rotten eggs. And to do that, you have to be stubborn."
8538	Stop shoving! The little one isn't getting any.
8539	"Juliet, you're scaring me just a little--"
8540	"No, the stupidest thing would be doing it backwards."
8541	This is just two years ago!
8542	"Left Below. Ooh, a ""He Is Risen"" production!"
8543	"OH, THOSE GOLDEN GRAHAMS/ OH, THOSE GOLDEN GRAHAMS/ CRISPY CRUNCHY GRAHAM CEREAL BRAND NEW BREAKFAST TREAT."
8544	"Good going, Lis. And it sure is great to be out of that bubble."
8545	"Springfield Preparatory School?! Dad, you told me there were no private schools in Springfield!"
8546	The Krusty Show sucks now. It's all pink and princessy. Why are great things always ruined by women? The Army... the Fantastic Four... think how awesome American Idol would be with just Simon and Randy!
8547	And it's gonna do wonders for our social life.
8548	Roses. So many roses.
8549	"You are so right, Ned. There won't be a single minute where Bart's not under the watchful eye of myself or... Homer, get over here!"
8550	"Ooh, look at all the inventions Edison came up with. The stock ticker, the storage battery, even wax paper. And look at him dance."
8551	"Water bill, third notice... jury duty, third notice... mortgage bill, ooh, second notice..."
8552	"Thank you! Thank you! But there was someone else with me on that alley. I'm talkin' about the big man, Carl."
8553	Bart! You can't just run away from this!
8554	"Marge, are you sure we should go drinking together? I mean, who am I gonna complain about while I'm drinking?"
8555	"No, no, no, no, you'll get sap on your duelling blouse."
8556	"Aren't you going to say ""Haw haw?"""
8557	Who's a stinky dog? You are! Michelle's going to work on you today.
8558	"Well, what do you call it?"
8559	"You can't touch electricity, Marge. You can't feel it."
8560	"Throw down your weapons and kiss the prairie, cowdorks."
8561	I'm looking for something in an attack dog. One who likes the sweet gamy tang of human flesh.
8562	"Well, maybe it would help him to be left back. It won't be so bad, Bart."
8563	Don't worry. No one's gonna see this stupid show.
8564	"Okay, okay! Just checking."
8565	Who knew having a backbone was attractive?
8566	Santa must have left it.
8567	I know! I'm working my way up to you.
8568	"Look at her in there, washing her body..."
8569	"Okay, there's a lot of low cards in that hand. But since we're both free, why don't you and me hit the town?"
8570	"No way... ""The Seven Habits of Highly Effective Pre-Teens?"" Is this all because of the...?"
8571	It's not chinchilla. I just thought she needed more sleep.
8572	If they're anybody's children they're mine!
8573	"Yeah, forget the donuts! We're here to go-nuts! Musically, that is!"
8574	We gotta get that tree back!
8575	"Doctor Hibbert, can I have my appendix out?"
8576	"Okay, but can I just finish the smarty-pants answer?"
8577	"All right, but not the imported."
8578	My hammock! Do you understand? Mine! Don't look that way.
8579	"Next time a commercial comes on, I'm gonna close my eyes, cover my ears and scream as loud as I can."
8580	"Marge, Marge! There I was, I had just caught the largest fish you'd ever seen, when I was abducted by a flying saucer!"
8581	"IN THE JUNGLE, THE CREEPY JUNGLE / HOMER RIDES A FREAK..."
8582	How did Santa's Little Helper get in there?
8583	It's best to concentrate on what you do have.
8584	"Well, you can't go wrong with cocktail weenies. They taste as good as they look. And they come in this delicious red sauce. It looks like catsup -- it tastes like ketchup. But brother it ain't ketchup!"
8585	I'm not a bully! It's just a series of incredible coincidences!
8586	"Compared to them, the public schools are a haven of enlightenment."
8587	Maybe he's gonna pee in the river.
8588	"Kent, let me make this perfectly clear. I have no dog."
8589	"Mom, I need a few hours off. It's Milhouse's birthday party and I'm all the guests."
8590	"This entire plant is in his name -- so when they come to put C. M. Burns in jail, it's the canary that does the time."
8591	"I don't know, but it is."
8592	"I don't want to be called ""Rusty"" again! I don't!"
8593	"Hey, I'm just hangin'."
8594	"Besides, he's happy just hanging around the house with Bart."
8595	I don't know. I kept away from Maggie all day.
8596	"Don't tell me you didn't reserve a campsite! Labor day is next weekend, there'll be nothing left!"
8597	I wouldn't ruin a surprise for Lenny.
8598	"C'mon, jus' one more drink, Marge."
8599	"Named after its discoverer, Professor Artemis Deadly, who was ironically killed in the shower of 1853."
8600	"Marge, calm down. For as long as there's been baking, there's been erotic baking. It fills a need, and harms no one."
8601	"Tell the truth! C'mon, everybody!"
8602	Homie! What happened to you?
8603	"Give it up, Lis. She's a criminal mastermind. She's got a 108 IQ, she reads at a fifth grade level, and her hair smells like red Fruit Loops."
8604	"You looken sharpen todayen, mein herr."
8605	Don't do that. Why should we both be outcasts?
8606	Can we use your phone?
8607	"Just charge me something, please."
8608	"I'm sorry, honey. All day long I have to listen to women talk."
8609	I dunno. Can you swing a sack of door knobs?
8610	Isn't there anything you can do to get your job back?
8611	Thank you! Thank you!
8612	"Wow! For free, ""SURPLUS DRUMS OF MAYONNAISE FROM OPERATION DESERT STORM."""
8613	"Okay, you two. Lights out."
8614	Beat the lumps. Beat the lumps. Beat the lumps.
8615	"Oh, I don't want to go in there with all the happy dancing couples."
8616	Really? You manage a whole office?
8617	"Doing pretty good so far. A key ring for Marge, key ring for Bart..."
8618	"I came out the elephant's mouth, right? 'Cause I already showered once today."
8619	"Yeah, they're not great."
8620	"Uhh... what about 2 cent stamps?... pizza pie's very hot these days, uh... can't open pickle jars, no mail on Sunday... out of paper towels... Oh! Oh! Oh! What's the deal with cardboard?..."
8621	"Oh. Gee thanks, mister."
8622	"I'll get even with whoever did this to you, boy. I swear it."
8623	"Who's joking?!! Oh, I don't know what you're saying! It all sounds so crazy to me!!"
8624	"Thanks, honey. After what you said to me, I watched hours and hours of soccer. I almost saw a goal! But there were so many ads for Spanish cell phones..."
8625	"So kids, its Valentine's Day, and you know what that means -- you get to stay downstairs watching TV with the sound turned way up."
8626	I feel kind of... melancholy...
8627	How much do those yo-yos cost?
8628	"Um, I think we're supposed to get off here."
8629	You've transformed breakfast into dinner. It's a miracle!
8630	"So did you see the show tonight? Remember the part where I forgot the words and I just sang ""Uh-oh Spaghetti-os"". I'm hoping they send me a case."
8631	"Look at that, a man's whole life being kicked around on the floor."
8632	"I need some cash, man."
8633	Woo hoo! Mom finally stopped caring!
8634	What if we... Van Houten to the max?
8635	Why would you do that? Are you a bad parent?
8636	"Bob, your family will find out the truth. Sooner or later you'll try to kill me again. Watch, I'll prove it."
8637	I helped Snake out of a jam so he paid me back in stolen stuff. It was an honorable arrangement. But I never thought he'd steal from you.
8638	"So Marge, in tomorrow's game I'm gonna recover a fumble just for you."
8639	"So, she didn't hate me. She married me because she loved me!"
8640	Any sugar around here?
8641	"Hey, these freaks do a lot of cool stuff. ""Cookouts, hayrides, bowling..."""
8642	"Bart, having never received any words of encouragement myself, I'm not sure how they're supposed to sound. But here goes. I believe in you."
8643	"Oh, yeah. He's really special."
8644	"Oh, it's just a mob war. Go back to sleep, Honey."
8645	"There's only two kinds of guys who wear those shirts -- gay guys, and big fat party-animals. And Bart doesn't look like a big fat party-animal to me."
8646	"Even Flanders agrees! This is our neighborhood. We were here first, so you should leave."
8647	"You're right, Lenny. I..."
8648	Marge... kids... the things I saw. It makes me never wanna eat meat again...
8649	"You know me, Marge. I crave the hustle and bustle."
8650	One cheese cube couldn't hurt.
8651	I knew you'd come crawling back.
8652	"Bart, with these powers, we can become superheroes!"
8653	I didn't know Cletus was your dad.
8654	You're right -- I'm giving up photography...
8655	"No, but the rabbi gave me this."
8656	"The saddest thing would be if you were driving and texting Lisa, and you hit her. And the last thing she texted, before she died, was ""I got your message."" G'night."
8657	We don't need a bed. We're not gonna be sleeping.
8658	"Guess what, everyone?! My great uncle Boris died and left us his old country house. There's only one catch they say - it's haunted. But I'm sure we can prove him wrong by spending the weekend there."
8659	"DO, DO, DO DO / DO, DOOO..."
8660	Stupid welcoming mint! Y'ello.
8661	...As Headmaster Greystash fought a battle to the finish with dark wizard Maluicious Krubb.
8662	So we're going to let the internet decide. Should Ned and Edna stay together? Visit thesimpsons.com and vote.
8663	"Chett, I'm here to ask you one simple thing: please go out of business and donate all your profits to charity."
8664	"Another super year with a super lady. Good night, honey."
8665	"Oh c'mon, Marge. It's not fair to compare us to an American household."
8666	"That's fine for you, Marge. But I used to rock and roll all night and party ev-a-ry day. Then it was every other day. Now I'm lucky if I can find half an hour a week in which to get funky. I've got to get out of this rut and back into the groove!"
8667	Who's an unproductive worker now?
8668	"Homie, I want you to promise me you'll cut down on the drinking."
8669	"Well, this is the first I've heard about it."
8670	"A gentle answer. Well, that is a jim-dandy idea. Bless you, Reverend."
8671	Troy McClure? He's a washed-up movie star. He could be dating washed-up supermodels.
8672	I'm gonna get a snack. But first... should I introduce the black plague? What could be the harm?
8673	It's sick! And I don't have that kind of money to spend on sex! Maybe you could get someone with money to sponsor your team. Like Mr. Burns.
8674	We're not here for rabbit. I used to live in this house as a girl.
8675	Please don't bring home anymore old crutches!
8676	"But you're just perpetuating a negative Italian-American stereotype. I mean, you could be a pizza man, organ grinder, uh... leaning tower maker... and... did I say pizza man?"
8677	"Good news, Lisa. I don't need your mother anymore. I've created a replacement that's superior to her in almost every way."
8678	Where's your sense of magic and wonder?
8679	Yes. They should go. Just as soon as they perform this musical I've written in celebration of our nation's birth.
8680	"Can you go five blasted minutes without saying the word ""virgin?"""
8681	I thought Springfield was America's scrod-basket.
8682	It's weird to see you as somebody's sidekick.
8683	"Swiss cheese. Marge, how come you're not saying anything?"
8684	"I'm glad you're okay honey, but I wish you'd chosen a more tasteful way to be patriotic."
8685	Marge! How could you?
8686	"For your information, Springfielders can be intelligent and articulate. I happen to know because we're from Springfield."
8687	"Look Smithers, the money and a very stupid man are still here."
8688	I am so pleased to meet you.
8689	The first step to liberation is to free ourselves from these... male imposed shackles.
8690	"You know Bart, I really like spending time with you."
8691	"Don't say it, Homer. This is not the time."
8692	"Bart, the saddest thing about this is I won't get to see you grow up, because..."
8693	Whoever did this will be haunted by unbearable guilt forever!
8694	"Oh, my sweet, sweet Homie! You sacrificed yourself for the manatees."
8695	Earth to Marge. Earth to Marge. I was there... the clown's G-I-L-L -T-Y.
8696	"Wow, Moe. Great shrub costume."
8697	"Flanders, what's your secret? You never get arrested, you don't buy your clothes at ""Mr. Blob"" and look at your beautiful lawn. It sickens me."
8698	"Give 'em hell, Homer."
8699	"Boy, that was worth the wait."
8700	"Patent pending... Patent pending... Patent pending... Hey, who's this guy?"
8701	"Cough syrup. Nothing but plain, ordinary, over the counter children's cough syrup!"
8702	"Homer, what are you doing here?"
8703	"Hey, what's that over there?"
8704	"Whoa, whoa, whoa, you don't want to go in there. Some of those babies have their teeth."
8705	I dig the Wig! I dig the Wig!
8706	"Homer Simpson, sir. One of the finest, bravest men ever to grace Sector 7G. I'll cross him off the list."
8707	"Mom, what are you doin' here? Did our house burn down? Whoa, that'd be cool."
8708	"Come on, Dad. Let's get outta here."
8709	"Well, I sure don't feel like cooking."
8710	You watch me. I'll grow something out there.
8711	"Wow, a secret staircase? But what do you do if somebody wants a non-alcoholic beer?"
8712	What?! You threw our precious babies into the woods?! We could have sold them!
8713	"Oh, you're gonna love it in Cuba, Marge. There's shredded pork everywhere."
8714	"Oh Dad, I got you some scotch. One of those fancy ones the checkout lady had to unlock the cabinet to get."
8715	"Honey, I like it when you call, but we just talked five minutes ago. Hang on, I've got call waiting."
8716	Quiet. I can't hear the eggs.
8717	I think I puked up all of my meanness.
8718	"Marge, can we trade? I don't trust these guys."
8719	"Um, happy birthday, Nelson."
8720	"Yeah, nothing is hurt except feelings."
8721	Lowering your blinds. I'd hate for your carpet to fade.
8722	"Are you ready for Irish announcers with lyrical accents, ""Oh, that's a lovely touch! Oh, such beautiful form!"" If we lose football, we lose the blitz, cheerleaders, Rudys, Ochocincos... something for fat kids to play! Ochocincos..."
8723	He wanted to be captured at the restaurant!
8724	"I don't know, I guess he forgot, but people seemed to like me last week."
8725	My dad is very sick. What's gonna happen if he dies?
8726	"Way to guard the parking lot, Top Gun."
8727	"Oh Homie, I'm so lucky to be married to such a selfless and loving man."
8728	You are smooth. I'll give you that.
8729	I'm gonna play naked basketball!
8730	I just need to get closer.
8731	"You got it, little buddy."
8732	"I'm Mr. Burns. Blah, blah, blah. Do this. Do that. Blah, blah, blah."
8733	"Wow, what kind of mileage does it get?"
8734	"The fifth graders played a great game. They got a great program up there, great fans, but this was just our day. Whatever happens, they can never take away--"
8735	"Well, I do walk through pretty much anything... Ohh, you kids are sweet."
8736	What are the odds on Santa's Little Helper?
8737	With an emerald that big I could buy anything -- a jalopy! An icebox! A steamer trunk full of fedoras! But how do I get my hands on it?
8738	"Sorry, but I was planning to stop by the Olympic Pin Center to fill in a few small gaps in my collection. Y'know, just to get me through the day."
8739	"Prison overcrowding, I've got a solution for that. Oh my God! U-S-A! U-S-A!"
8740	"Well, I'm sure it is, but why do we want to do that?"
8741	"Ooh! Well, now I really hope my chute opens!"
8742	"Yeah, you look great! You can do anything with that sewing machine."
8743	Forbearance is the watchword. That triumvirate of Twinkies merely overwhelmed my resolve.
8744	"My lady's glass is empty, Moe. Bring her another cookies 'n' creme martini."
8745	"Oh, I'm not going to lie to you, Marge. So long!"
8746	"He's got us, Marge. There's nothing we can do. He's as good as dead."
8747	"Hey, this car's got cruise control."
8748	"Ah, Smithers, if I didn't arrest you that night in the park, I'm not gonna arrest you now."
8749	Return the spear to the homo erectus. Homo erectus? Where has that word been all my life?
8750	This ghost town is gonna be great. Now with 30 percent more gunfights!
8751	All eggnog is terrible!
8752	"Hi, Ralph... um, I just wanted to tell you there was a tooth in the valentine you gave me."
8753	Take me someplace fun.
8754	"Ready for the circus, Homer?"
8755	"Hey Lenny, is your film appropriate for kids?"
8756	"Indeed it is. ""Evergreen Terrace"" is built atop a massive shale deposit."
8757	"Excellent, excellent!"
8758	"Hello, Bigger Brothers? My name is Bart Simpson and I don't have a father."
8759	I don't approve of that.
8760	Keep your eyes peeled for Injuns... I mean Native Americans. They're after us because we gave them those blankets infected with cooties.
8761	"Lisa ""wants"" ""a"" ""dot dot dot""..."
8762	"You know, I'd like to thank God for all my success, even though I never worshipped or believed in Him in any way. But before I sweep up my last spotlight, there's one thing I've gotta say..."
8763	"Oh, that's wonderful!"
8764	"Gotcha! Take this as a warning, kids. Bart Simpson is the ultimate bad boy. Befriend him and you'll wind up just like him -- a rebel who does what he wants, when he wants. Wow. Come on, tough guy -- let's go."
8765	Isn't this song a little boastful?
8766	And that man sold it to me!
8767	Her shapely gams have finally persuaded me to switch from the Julian calendar to the Gregorian!
8768	"You think you're cool because you buy a five hundred dollar phone with a picture of a fruit on it?! Well, guess what? They cost eight bucks to make and I pee on every one!"
8769	Son of a gun-diddily-un! Those gilded edges smart!
8770	"Hi, Patty. Hi, Selma."
8771	AMAZING GRACE / HOW LOUD I SING / TO DROWN THE SPOILERS OUT... shut up. Shut up. Shut up!
8772	I think I'll go to bed.
8773	"Mom, I'm gonna lose it! Bart's on the cover of both local jazz magazines: ""Blowin'"" and ""The Sugar Sheet""."
8774	God doesn't need Twitter to reach people. He uses leprosy and plagues.
8775	"Oh hello, Kent. Right now, skilled nuclear energy technicians are calmly correcting a minor, piffling malfunction."
8776	"Listen, when you see what's inside this..."
8777	"Listen, Luke. It's my fault Clara got lost. I didn't know she was your sister, and I wanted you all to myself."
8778	"School's starting, Bart. Aren't you excited? This year you learn about local history!"
8779	"Mmm, load-bearing wall."
8780	It was a typical day for delivery man Avery Mann. Until...
8781	"Get moving, you stupid... When I'm kicking you, that means ""hurry up"". Come on!"
8782	Maybe you could give us a personal tour of your country.
8783	"Whayda ya know, she's right."
8784	Ralph! Ralph! Ralph! Ralph!
8785	I'd like to say something about the current climate of repression and fear.
8786	What are you doing?! You're gonna get hurt!
8787	Can we do it this week?
8788	"Unless you're gonna slap some wieners on those, turn 'em off!"
8789	"So, New Springfield's lookin' pretty good now, isn't it? With our ample parking and daily Who concerts."
8790	A relationship I continued to this day.
8791	"Okay, once more. Where are we going?"
8792	"Oh, you mean about you. All right, maybe I said some things -- some personal things. But, you should have seen 'em, Marge. They really wanted to hear what I had to say."
8793	Will you make my sundae for me?
8794	"Now Homer, if there's anything else I can do for you, please don't hesitate to ask."
8795	"Bart, what's taking so long? If you're having that problem with your zipper, I can send your father up."
8796	"Now, boys, Mr. Simpson is the guest. He gets to decide what to watch."
8797	"Uh, yeah. Hey, listen, your mom thinks that maybe you and I should have dinner together, sometime..."
8798	"Goodnight, sweetheart."
8799	Which is lucky for me because you're always right.
8800	"It's the natural order of things. I'm afraid she's got another two, maybe three days, tops."
8801	"Yeeesch! This house stinks! You're not just putting the new newspapers over the old ones, are you?"
8802	"Homer, you will find her a man."
8803	"All right, Marge. I swear to you, the next time he does something wrong I'll punish him and make it stick."
8804	"Rod, get off of there!"
8805	Yes! You thought I couldn't but I could I did! and I could do it again let's do it again!
8806	Why you little! I'll teach you to answer peoples' prayers!
8807	"All week, my life long dream was to be the next Thomas Edison, but now it's over. I guess I'll just give up my hopes and dreams and settle for being a decent husband and father."
8808	"Ah, please, everyone, stay away. We don't want anyone to be a hero. A hero. A hero!"
8809	"Little higher, Wendell... A lot higher, Martin... Ah, Ralph, that's a basketball."
8810	"What are you doing? If they fight in front of us, we might get new bikes!"
8811	"Now, sit! I said sit!"
8812	From Milhouse! I love him so much!
8813	But my apologies always sound so forced.
8814	"Yeah, I agree. I mean, you are pretty annoying."
8815	"I mean don't worry, son. I forgot to get you a present. But I swear on my father's grave..."
8816	That's it. Cinch it up around the neck.
8817	Directory assistance?
8818	"Hey, so are the Grammy judges. --"
8819	"C'mon boy, let's get me a six-pack."
8820	And did you know that little Baby Jesus grew up to be... Jesus?
8821	I can't believe he pays you so little. The crowd was crazy about you.
8822	"LIFT ME, WON'T YOU LIFT ME / ABOVE THE OLD ROUTINE / MAKE IT NICE, PLAY IT CLEAN, JAZZMAN..."
8823	The Swedish are coming! The Swedish are coming!
8824	"Hey, where's Charlie? How'd he get out of this?"
8825	"Uh, this industry moves so fast, it's really hard to tell. That's why I need a name that's cutting edge, like Cutco... or Edgecom... Interslice... Come on, Marge -- you're good at these. Help me out."
8826	"I'm very happy for you, Ned."
8827	I'm using your unfinished novel!
8828	"Why don't we legalize same-sex marriage? We can attract a growing segment of the marriage market, and strike a blow for civil rights."
8829	"Moe, I could believe this was a random occurrence, or I could believe some higher power reached down and squeezed the sap outta that tree. I'm choosin' hope! Moe, a bottle of your finest beer!"
8830	"Hey, everybody, I've got a big surprise for you! Presenting: my mother!"
8831	"Bob, your generosity and abondanza have touched our hearts."
8832	What are you talking about? This car is cooler than Guy Lombardo.
8833	"School? Oh my God, I've wasted the whole summer. There's so many things I still wanna do."
8834	"Moe, these fragments are fascinating. ""I was in the Christmas pageant once. Mom showed up with a new boyfriend. He called me Steve."""
8835	"Now, why don't you stay for dinner."
8836	"At bedtime, he tucks me in tighter than anyone else could. And you know what? No monsters have gotten me yet."
8837	Trying to fix your broken brain.
8838	"LaBoot, LaBoot. Sounds familiar."
8839	The Demolition Derby? That'll scratch my itch.
8840	"But sweetie, I just wanted to tell the '74 Oakland A's how I felt about them."
8841	He's turned it into a prison!
8842	You know what? I'm not gonna. My mustache has the right to life -- it's my body and my choice!
8843	Dad. That still sounds weird to me. But I'm glad we're friends again.
8844	You really speak Italian?!
8845	"Well, you know people can kinda act like they're in grade school."
8846	Now hold on just a minute. Nobody said anything about shooting.
8847	"Well, you're very welcome, Lurleen. Of all the women who've hit on Homer over the years, you're my favorite."
8848	"Yeah, but I'm a cop first... then a boat enthusiast... amateur historian... yo-yo dieter... then I'm a cop again..."
8849	"Uh... nothing, Marge. I think it must have been that bean I had for dinner."
8850	"Moe, this is Astrid, my ""dealer."" And these are my fans, Gunter, Kyoto, and Cecil Hampstead-on-Cecil-Cecil."
8851	"Okay. To save the manatees, I guess I could donate my time and money and help them build a... eh, screw that."
8852	"Homie, I don't think we'll be able to find the kids from up here."
8853	"This magazine you sold me isn't ""Fantastic Four."" It's ""Fantastic Floor""!"
8854	Is that the cat in there?!
8855	I'm not sure I can afford a fancy lawyer.
8856	Because I suspect deep within you is an artist's soul.
8857	You're gonna have to fail that history test sooner or later.
8858	Absolutely not! My adult frame is simply too large. No! Never! Fine! Here I come!
8859	"You got that right. Remember the time he ate my goldfish and you lied to me and said I never had any goldfish? But why'd I have the bowl, Bart? Why did I have the bowl?"
8860	"The Springfield Opera House, of which I am founder, artistic director, and standing ovation starter, is producing La BohÃ¨me. I want you to sing the lead."
8861	"Say ""goose,"" you stupid freak!"
8862	You've filled my head with horse poop and atheism! And all these years I thought I was unteachable.
8863	"Testing... Testing for Mr. Burns. Here you go, Sir. I've warmed up the crowd for you."
8864	I want you to look into the faces of those poor men -- each one is a life you made worse with your ratting.
8865	Shh! They'll hear you.
8866	Hm... what's changed for me since the last time I saw you? Only... everything!
8867	"No problem. We'll just circle around like those kids in ""The Blair Witch Project."""
8868	"Easy there, hotshot. All the people are doing is watchin' a movie."
8869	"Come on! Give it! I know, I'll try reverse psychology. I don't want that stupid map."
8870	"Hey boy, why don't I do that for you?"
8871	Maybe you should shut up.
8872	"Smithers, this beer isn't working. I don't feel any younger or ""funkier."""
8873	Poor Chip. Such a big part of everyone's life.
8874	"Wha... hey, moose! Shoo! Go! Talkin' to you! Get off my lawn! Now!"
8875	I could see a planetarium show without the secondhand marijuana!
8876	"Hey, wait... ""Hyper-Obesity."" ""If you weigh more than 300 pounds, you qualify as disabled."""
8877	Wow! I've never seen Dad hit somebody like that before!
8878	"Actually, silverware is all that's left on the registry."
8879	I don't think that's a very good idea.
8880	"Oh, man. This is the most exciting thing I've seen since Haley's Comet collided with the moon!"
8881	"Get off your duffs, boys. Get down to that studio!"
8882	"Have no fear, the star is here!"
8883	"Okay, you can go out and play, but... no more you know what in front of the house, all right?"
8884	"Say your prayers, Simpson..."
8885	Let's call the company.
8886	The sun? That's the hottest place on Earth!
8887	It's not a skirt. It's a kilt!
8888	"Where did these ""Devil Donuts"" come from?"
8889	There's an open house next door. They're giving out cookies and business cards!
8890	I feel it would be best if we just stayed friends.
8891	"Ooo, I guess it's time for me to duck again."
8892	"Pish tush! Wayne, as a reward for your valiant fisticuffery, I hereby award you the Springfield Nuclear Plant Silver Safety Hat!"
8893	"Let's see here. ""We the people... cruel and unusual... blah, blah, blah... ritual circumcision... yak, yak, yak..."" Aw geez, I'll take your word for it. I guess you are in charge."
8894	"Well, Homer and I are looking forward to your visit, too."
8895	"All is lost... Angelica uses the spell she learned in chapter six... Magic, magic, magic... All is won!"
8896	That's your advice?! Go to bed!
8897	"You're rich, Grampa! You did it! And Burns can never take that away from you!"
8898	"But Marge, the barflies are expecting me... Moe, and Barney and that guy who calls me Bill..."
8899	"Hmm... All right, but don't lose them. They're my only pair."
8900	"Y'know, Simpson, I feel kinda silly, but what the hay... you know, it kinda reminds me of my good ole' fraternity days."
8901	"And then... and then wha... and then what happened... what... gee, my story doesn't make much sense except the Santa part."
8902	"Ow, my head... Oh. I need a beer."
8903	"Back then, we were both stars - in the thrill-a-minute world of high school journalism."
8904	How can I end this torture?!
8905	They're not going to get away with this.
8906	The best part was when the buildings fell down!
8907	... but I believe that the cartoons you show to our children are influencing their behavior in a negative way...
8908	"Wow, that story had everything: action, treasure, water, a guy... would you like to come to our house for dinner?"
8909	"Well, we may not have the store, but at least we're friends again."
8910	"Yep, but they gave me these Rollerblades so I can glide to the front door."
8911	"Ha, ha. You know something, he did say 'well' a lot."
8912	"Homer, you're doing drugs!"
8913	How could you let this happen?
8914	Endorsed by the American Carny Association.
8915	"No more TV! We're gonna get some fresh air, and visit the Museum... of Television."
8916	That's it! I want a license!
8917	"Mom, Dad, do you know there's a boat out there where nothing sucks? It's called Royalty Cruises and Royalty Cruise specialists are standing by now!"
8918	"Screamapillar Care Tips. Wow, look at all this stuff. ""Without constant reassurance, it will die. It's sexually attracted to fire..."""
8919	"Guys, I'm comin' back in. Suck in your guts."
8920	Huh? Where are the bees?
8921	"Fine! I'll do ""Teen Wolf III."" I've got fair-weather friends to feed."
8922	"Sweet maiden of the spit, grant now my boon, that I mightst sup on suckling pig this noon."
8923	"Aw, the flash didn't go off. Ya got another one in you, Josh?"
8924	"Up, up and away, in my beautiful, my beautiful motor boattt... Da-da-da-da-da."
8925	Um... the battery seems to be dead. I'll get some help by hidin' in that bush.
8926	"So Bart was revealed as a coward, and now it seemed like the whole world was against him."
8927	I SHOT THE SHERIFF / BUT I DID NOT SHOOT THE DEP-U-TY
8928	The only person who thinks you're a monster is the one who had to give you a sponge bath.
8929	"Yes sir, this is gonna be the best week of our young lives."
8930	Now I suppose you both have to sign this. I hope blood won't be necessary.
8931	"Gotta think! Gotta think! Okay, somewhere there's a thingee that tells you how to work this stuff. The um... the, uh... the manual! The manual! RIGHT."
8932	"Oh, how very kind of you. I am not giving our kids to these gravelly-voiced super hags! One lump, please."
8933	"I don't understand that on any level, but yes."
8934	"Hey Bart, where you going?"
8935	Um... remember that Corvette I had?
8936	"Well, it's not that I don't love the guy. I'm always sticking up for him. It's just that he's so self-centered."
8937	Patty and Selma are dead? Woo hoo! A double funeral!
8938	Who are those freaks?
8939	"Homie, I love you. But you can be a challenge, like doing the Daily Jumble."
8940	"Y'see, Bob, Bart was never convinced you were Walt."
8941	"I, uh, I don't think you wanna see her just now."
8942	"All right, then. Uh, how about this?"
8943	"Yep, the Simpsons have never married or even shook hands with anyone interesting. In a world of thirty-one flavors, we're the cup of water they rinse the scoops in. Grampa out."
8944	I stand by my wedding toast!
8945	This oughta hold 'em.
8946	"Okay, all I gotta do is take a quick ferry to Isla Verde, find CafÃ© Artiste, and they'll back up Kirk's story. That will prove the painting was his -- and now ours."
8947	"Uh, let's see... 18... 27... 35. Dealer busts. Looks like you all win again."
8948	Really? Excuse me for just a moment.
8949	"See, Abe, we're still visiting you, even though we have no biological obligation."
8950	That's why I got duplicates!
8951	"Mom, there's nothing to be alarmed about, but could you take one last look at the family and join me in the kitchen?"
8952	"Well, thank you for calling. Good-bye."
8953	"Actually, you made one. What Shakespeare really said was ""'twere well it were done quickly."""
8954	"Hey, Nelson. He's really hurt. I think he broke his leg."
8955	I didn't know you cared about ballet.
8956	"Dear God, what have I done?"
8957	"And I'd get to take a plane there, wouldn't I, Mom?"
8958	Can you make me beautiful?
8959	"The only thing we can do. Sit tight, and try to get some sleep."
8960	"I know it seems that way, because I'm such a vivid storyteller. Now here's another story called ""Bart's Mistake."" We were walking home when"
8961	"Good point, Dad. What would Jesus do?"
8962	Our. Water. Was. On. Fire!
8963	"Lightning?! Well, at least it wasn't my fault."
8964	You're just making it worse. I promise I won't hurt you.
8965	You didn't do anything.
8966	You'll be like an owl saying Milhouse who? Milhouse who? Milhouse whooo?
8967	"Mom, that's blasphemy! I'll say a rosary for you."
8968	"So, wait a minute. This means I'm gonna be a failure?"
8969	Wait a minute... Marge likes a little bit of stubble.
8970	Street signs? Indoors?! Whatever.
8971	"Play along! Ooh, this couldn't feel more natural. Glug, glug, glug. That's a good little mammal."
8972	The truth is that I'm perfect and everything I touch is perfect!
8973	"Holy moly, we can't stay here. It's full of raccoons."
8974	"Bart didn't get one vote?! Oh, this is the worst thing that ever happened to us. Alright, allright, spilled milk, spilled milk, spilled milk. What are you so mopey about?"
8975	"Ahh, the daily newspaper."
8976	Lemonade! Sweet sunshine in your mouth! Buy a cup or I punch my sister!
8977	This was before the day of safety seats and coming to a complete stop to let your child get in.
8978	"Well, I know it's a little risky and it's gonna be a lot of hard work, but gosh darn it, it's gonna be a lot of fun, too."
8979	It's so nice having everything back to normal.
8980	"The answer is ""bonbon""!"
8981	"Ah, Homer, why don't you plow it again?"
8982	"Boy, get out of that cage!"
8983	"Extra tentacles, please."
8984	"The Girls of the Internet. Ooh, I'd go on line with them any day."
8985	WHAT EVERYTHING'S BEEN BUILDING TOOOO /
8986	If you can't build a robot... be a robot!
8987	"Okay, so maybe that thing's a hunk of junk, but look at what you're selling!"
8988	Leave everything to me.
8989	I am familiar with the works of Pablo Neruda.
8990	"Every day, same old cat. I'll make him more interesting."
8991	Get down. Security guard.
8992	"Okay God, I bumped off the love of my life, according to your divine whim. Now release me from this ghastly vocation."
8993	"You found my baby. Oh, thank you, thank you, thank you!"
8994	They're having a conversation. They actually enjoy talking to each other.
8995	"I too am not a bit tamed, I too am untranslatable... Walt Whitman, ""Leaves of Grass""."
8996	Lamp those gams! You were one nifty number!
8997	I was thinking of something a little more... adult.
8998	"Let's just change the subject. Bart, would you like to say grace?"
8999	"Aw, that's sweet, honey. I'll bring you back a hat."
9000	You should be glad I did. Your father wanted to call you Bartzeena!
9001	"Yeah, I missed you guys too. Now if you'll excuse me..."
9002	"At five-fifteen an hour, it would take an eternity to make my fortune back -- and FICA wasn't helping."
9003	Leave them for whom? The Germans? The folks who shoot at us all day? Let's just take them. We'll all be rich! Rich as Nazis!
9004	I'm not made of money.
9005	"Maggie, can you say ba-ba? Can you say Ma-ma?"
9006	"Lenny! It's me, Homer!"
9007	We have to do something until the storm passes. Now just fill out these customs forms and we can get started.
9008	Wow. I wonder where all the rats are gonna go.
9009	"You can stir it into my mush. Either way, just gimme, gimme, gimme."
9010	Get in! Move it! This is not a drill!
9011	"Well, no way I'm giving a valentine to Nelson. He's a bully, and I do not love him."
9012	"Sir, you're my god of generosity."
9013	"Don't you worry, Mr. Mayor, this little bird will be crackin' rocks by the end of the week."
9014	Are you sure someone hasn't been bitten by the jealousy bug?
9015	"Oh, brought some of your commie friends to help you fight dirty, eh?"
9016	We need another Vietnam to thin out their ranks a little...
9017	"I'm tired of watching you dog it on that football field. From now on, I'm gonna work you like a dog. Now go fetch me twenty laps."
9018	How do we un-repress it?
9019	"Oh, how could Alec and Kim just cut me out of their lives?"
9020	When will you be home?
9021	"My God, are you always on?"
9022	"Aw, cheer up, you've still got your talent, and that new song you wrote is gonna be a really big hit."
9023	"Whoa, am I seeing this right?"
9024	"Cupcakes, cupcakes. Yes, sweet cakes for all."
9025	"Say your name? Why should I do that, my lad?"
9026	"Diddily, Diddily, diddily, diddily!"
9027	I know. And this perpetual motion machine she made today is a joke. It just keeps going faster and faster.
9028	Because it's so dilapidated.
9029	Have you been in here all day?
9030	Teen abstinence counseling! You get to pass out abstinence pledges and make sure the kids sign their John Han-bleeps.
9031	"Yeah, good work, Eddie."
9032	"Lisa, never, ever stop in the middle of a hoe-down."
9033	That kind of small scale violence solves nothing.
9034	"You know, Krabappel just needs to chill out and realize life is cool. But how?"
9035	I just want to know who dropped the dime on Dad. Lousy rat.
9036	"Marge, the dog is hungry!"
9037	Stupid angry mob... chasing me because I shine a harsh light on modern society. Now I know how Dane Cook feels.
9038	"A little too well, if you ask me. I'm sure he's plotting some brilliant scheme to get those puppies."
9039	At least Maggie can fly us home.
9040	"Words hurt, you know."
9041	They are my only escape from the drudgery of work and family.
9042	"Homie, you know I'm usually good for a triple-X throw down, but between those kids and going to Uncle Tyrone's, we can't be alone."
9043	My biggest sin is that I dare to hope.
9044	You were pocket-dialed!
9045	"It's like being married to my best friend, and he lets me feel his boobs."
9046	"Well, I did miss a few things about the grid... like everything!"
9047	Mr. Smithers' father!
9048	"Well, Jack here will do great work for you."
9049	"Homer, I think that chip's got enough dip on it."
9050	"What do you care, Mrs. Krabappel... or should I say, Mrs. Crab Apple?"
9051	"Shame on all of you. Give me my dignity! I just came here to see ""Honk If You're Horny"" in peace."
9052	"Not right now, son. Daddy's talking to a policeman."
9053	The last place I saw it...
9054	"Well, all right, go ahead."
9055	"Marge, I'm sorry I was proud of myself."
9056	"Whoa, bonanza! Let's load it up before the rats regroup."
9057	"Hmm... me, the patriarch of a bird-racing dynasty..."
9058	You had no right to make my bosom this ample!
9059	For sneaking! My next clue came just yesterday at the museum. We felt slighted by your age-bashing and started home.
9060	What's the point of all this cleaning? Are we so vain?
9061	Why did you put my name on the sign?
9062	"Whoa, whoa, whoa! You can't just whale on him because he's... what religion are you anyway?"
9063	"Homer, maybe Mr. Burns will bowl a great game and you will win your championship."
9064	You guys have treated me like a princess. Every day's been like the first ten minutes of Mother's Day!
9065	"Yeah, yeah. Now howzabout introducin' me to that cute little pay phone out front?"
9066	Thank you all for coming.
9067	You pulled the boys out of school?!
9068	"Why Homer, you silly goose! The weed whacker's just for the edges! You're gonna be out here all day!"
9069	"All right, Broadway's too expensive, the museums are over-curated -- but Shakespeare in the Park is tonight, and the tickets are free!"
9070	"Okay, Musk. What do you propose?"
9071	"Bye, guys. You really helped me a lot."
9072	All the years I've lobbied to be treated like an adult has blown up in my face.
9073	"I'm sorry I shot you, Moe."
9074	You know Rainier Wolfcastle?
9075	"Here's how it's gonna go down. As a family, we drive away. We cover for each other -- as a family. It's what Gabriel would have wanted."
9076	What am I -- a doctor?
9077	"Honey, Daddy's waiting for the detective."
9078	"Hey, you're welcome to see the dynamic duo any time."
9079	Don't tell me I'm not capable of good behavior!
9080	"Oh, this is great stuff -- I can pad it out to ten pages. Goodnight, Grampa."
9081	"Y-- You? Ah, no offense, but you're a decrepit monkey skeleton."
9082	What are you so happy about?
9083	"Dad, you've got to let Bart see that movie. I've never seen him like this. He has the demented melancholia of a Tennessee Williams heroine."
9084	Jumpin' Johnnycakes! Those dames are cheesed.
9085	A European Union?! Good heavens!
9086	"Forgive us, Dad, but it takes time to properly sugarcoat a response."
9087	"Well, I'm no Margaret Cho, but I do a pretty fair Columbo impression. Ah, one more thing - One- I should get a glass of water."
9088	"Oh, good, Reverend Lovejoy will make Marge take me back. He has to push the sanctity of marriage or his God will punish him."
9089	"Son, one day you're going to be a great father."
9090	"Homer, our marriage isn't on a piece of bark! It's in us! Now take my hand!"
9091	"Hey, I've been around Scotsmen."
9092	AND YOU LIKE TOMATO...
9093	You haven't had any tea.
9094	"Now, whoever finishes first gets a lemonade..."
9095	"Oh great! And uh, try to put a good face on this. Tell them this is one of those places where rich women lose weight."
9096	"Shut up, shut up, shut up!"
9097	Club soda will get that blood out.
9098	"Dad, there's a bug on that."
9099	"Manjula, come quick! The octuplets said their first words."
9100	You can stop lookin' at me now.
9101	You can't make that stuff up!
9102	"I know he doesn't look like him, but I'll never forget that voice!"
9103	"Mouse pad! Double click! Skyyype! Uh, Skyyype! Matthew twenty-three: ""Then spake Jesus to the multitude, and to his disciples, saying--"""
9104	You might say that. My wife's gonna leave me 'cause she thinks I'm a pig.
9105	We are not staying at Moe's. Maggie's already drunk on the fumes. And she's a mean drunk.
9106	"Seymour? Glad you're here. You can help me play ""Halloween Hit and Run."""
9107	This money was a blessing. We can't just spend it on some creature comfort.
9108	"What's that, floating mask? Y-You want me to shoot everyone?"
9109	That's your Christian name. What's your surname?
9110	"Lurleen Lumpkin has a hole in her heart, and I'm gonna fill it."
9111	I was just with Dr. Hibbert. He said I was under a lot of stress and should get some help.
9112	"Well, let's see what I've packed for myself today. One bouillon cube, one concord grape, one Philly cheesesteak, and a jar of garlic pickles. No one will want to kiss me after these, eh, Smithers?"
9113	"Man, you get a lot of nutcases in here."
9114	Barf for your master!
9115	"Hello, Principal Dondelinger."
9116	"Yeah. Excuse me, I'm looking for someone named, Jay Leno."
9117	"Well when you meet them, tell them your game's too easy."
9118	"If you all go, then I have to pay for a babysitter!"
9119	So lame that it's cool?
9120	I just did that because it was a series of funny words!
9121	"Oh, yeah. Two more of these, please."
9122	"Now Smithers, I need your advice picking out a gift for a very dear friend of mine. A single fellow, a bit quiet, but one with a warm loyal heart."
9123	"Twinkle the Kidd, I love you!"
9124	"Are you sure you want to go through with this, sir? You do have a very full wardrobe as it is."
9125	"Sweetheart, I think you'll feel better after we take a little walk..."
9126	I have an idea. But I must go alone. My car is filled with printer paper I stole from work.
9127	No! We have to reach people whose opinions actually matter. And I think I know how. Why don't we...
9128	My dear... did you just fall from heaven? 'Cause your hair looks really messed up.
9129	"Here we are, kids! The Watergate."
9130	"Homer's Pie Man costume, Lisa's red dress, Lisa's red dress, Lisa's red dress, Sunday-best Bart..."
9131	"Behold, Neanderthal man -- our ugliest, stupidest ancestor!"
9132	Looks like the bubble burst.
9133	"That's very nice, Dad, but it's wrong for you to reward violent, competitive behavior. However, I will sit up front with you if it's a fatherly gesture of love."
9134	What am I gonna do? I need a pinch-runner with speed!
9135	All right! Here comes the implosion!
9136	Do they know how many eggs it laid in your brain?
9137	This is much sadder than I expected.
9138	"Look, if you're going to stay in my room, could you at least stop making up gibberish?"
9139	"Come on, guys. We're gonna be late."
9140	"Well, I can breathe out okay."
9141	"Fine, but I wish you'd picked an easier theme than ""Super-Jet Dinosaur Fun-Monkeys."" What does that even mean?"
9142	I can't promise I'll try. But I'll try to try.
9143	Half my life gone! And I'm only guaranteed thirty-eight more years.
9144	The man who lived next door until his house blew down.
9145	"Never forget, Homer, there's no muscle stronger than the human heart."
9146	"Oh, I miss you too, Marge. But the law needs me. I'll be home as soon as I can."
9147	Well how are we supposed to get fuel?
9148	"Listen, baby. The other night was great, but it can never happen again. Oh, who am I kidding? I have to see you right now!"
9149	"Bobo I know I say this every century, but I'll never leave you behind again."
9150	And the spirit of neighborly cooperation broke out as if all the weird angry people had left.
9151	"Bart, stop fooling around. Homer, stop encouraging him."
9152	"The spotted hawk accuses me, he complains of my gab."
9153	"Fetch Daddy's thinner, boy."
9154	The geyser's one of the most famous natural wonders in... Iceland. I guess that's where Carl's from.
9155	"Well, my special mix tape will get you going."
9156	"Uh... yeah, I have that disease that makes you look like an old man, but they gave me medicine for it and I took too much."
9157	"You just want somebody to say ""I love you"". I love you."
9158	That's all that happened? And I got to miss work?
9159	Bodacious Frittatas? Buffet the Hunger Slayer?
9160	"Hey, Flanders. Is everything okay?"
9161	But you look better... you don't sweat while you eat anymore... and look.
9162	"Nothing is going to happen, Mom. I hate to disappoint you, but the world is not coming to an end."
9163	"Marge! Marge, where's the baby?"
9164	"Homer, what are you doing?!"
9165	"Homer, do you know why I married you?"
9166	That's the same thing! You just replaced dees with doos!
9167	"We've got to be realistic, kids. Who's gonna have a big enough heart to take care of twenty-five puppies?"
9168	"Hey, I didn't shoot anybody. They took my gun, they took my badge... hell, they would have taken my squad car if I hadn't hid it under some hay."
9169	"Hey, are you like one of those English guards who can't laugh or smile or anything?"
9170	Son! Don't go up that mountain! You'll die up there! Just like I did!
9171	I'M GONNA MAKE IT AFTER ALL!
9172	"Wait, shutup... I just thought of something!"
9173	You can't be these people's leader if you're lying to them about who you are. You're not gay!
9174	"They're singing! They're singing, Marge! Why aren't they killing each other?"
9175	Are you sure Mom and Dad want us to enter a European balloon race?
9176	"Hey, can I have some turkey?"
9177	Isn't that cute? He thinks he's a pack.
9178	"Do you know this baby once out-raced the Flying Finn, Paavo Nurmi?"
9179	"Homer Simpson! Ask yourself -- ""W.W.B.J.D.?"""
9180	Dad? Did you just call?
9181	"Dad, stop kidding around. Look, they printed my letter."
9182	How do I get outta here?
9183	"Why'd you do it, man?"
9184	Can't you yell at me now and get it over with?
9185	"Bored, are ya? Lisa, go cut me a switch."
9186	Just vote! It's your duty as a citizen of TV.
9187	"Okay, America. Inspire me."
9188	"Here's a poem: ""run fast, or lose your ass""!"
9189	"Yep, we occupy that useless mass of land between Los Angeles and New York. Called America!"
9190	Oh yeah. / That's it.
9191	I never graduated from high school.
9192	"Wow, two finds in one store! What are the odds?"
9193	"You're just as bad as me. And you used to be better, so that makes you worse! I don't think we can ever trust each other again."
9194	"Oh. I see how it is. Actually, I don't. My glasses are fogged."
9195	I hope we haven't stumbled onto my anniversary present.
9196	"Stopping Mr. Burns may be beyond the power of an eight-year-old girl with a book report due on ""Beezus and Ramona."" But I know someone who can help..."
9197	Are you really the head of the Kwik-E-Mart?
9198	Why do pie makers get all the girls?
9199	"Mrs. Krabappel, I can't take the test. I have a stomach ache."
9200	"Run, young lovers! I'll take care of the cops!"
9201	"You know, Homer, it's very easy to criticize."
9202	"Hold it right there, Forrest Plump. This town has laws against impersonating movie characters."
9203	"Yeah, but this is me talking. Look, I already encased the telephone in concrete."
9204	"Well, if I know doctors, he's probably golfing."
9205	The mirror. The mirror!
9206	"Hidilly ho, neighbor. Wanna go to the game with me? I got two tic..."
9207	"Scrub harder, slave. I want to be able to eat off that thing. And make it snappy, it's almost lunchtime."
9208	"Half a gallon of chocolate, chocolate, chocolate, chocolate chip."
9209	You... invited me... to your treehouse? Wow -- that's like Bruce Wayne letting his mother into the Bat-club.
9210	THERE WAS A LITTLE SPANISH FLEA... A RECORD STAR HE THOUGHT HE'D BE... HE HEARD OF SINGERS LIKE BEATLES... THE CHIPMUNKS HE'D SEEN ON TV... WHY NOT A LITTLE SPANISH FLEA? AND SO HE HID... INSIDE A DOG...
9211	"Marge, forget it. He's bigger than me, faster than me, stronger than me and he already has more friends around the plant than I do."
9212	Ooh. That takes me back. God bless you Shary Bobbins.
9213	I really don't want to talk about it.
9214	"Mom, no! Everyone at school picks on the ""PÃ¶pli"" kids. Even I do. I just hate them so much."
9215	WE'RE GOING TO A REST'RANT GRAND OP'NIIIIIIIING... / BUT DON'T FILL UP ON BREAD!
9216	"Dad, it's getting cold out here."
9217	"Hey, I don't see your name engraved on the bar stool."
9218	So you're the brown nosed reindeer that's jingled all the way to the top.
9219	I've got a bad feeling about this. Let's check the suit closet.
9220	"Why don't we have fun like that, Lou?"
9221	Fossils shmossils. You can't stop progress 'cause of some moldy old bones. Bones shmones.
9222	"Are you kidding? There's Funky Winkerbean! Over here, Funky! Look, it's the Noid! Avoid the Noid! He ruins pizzas!"
9223	"Check it out, I'm a business jerk!"
9224	"Oh, I'm gonna enjoy this."
9225	I SLUGGED SOME JERK IN TAHOE / THEY GAVE ME ONE TO THREE / MY HIGH-PRICED LAWYER SPRUNG ME ON A TECH-NI-CAL-I-TY / I'M JUST VISITING SPRINGFIELD PRISON / I GET TO SLEEP AT HOME TONIGHT --
9226	They'll pay for what they did to my can.
9227	"I feel like I'm gonna die, Bart."
9228	"Well, they all have their charms..."
9229	"Aw, come on. If you're really Michael Jackson, who were your last four dates for the Grammys?"
9230	My name is Marge Simpson and I have an idea. It may sound a little boring at first...
9231	"Homer, I'm glad you're getting exercise, I just wish it wasn't crazy exercise."
9232	"Yeah, me too. Since her father re-abandoned her, she's cut the word ""pop"" out of all of our foods."
9233	Hmm... it's starting to cool down. I'll bake another pie.
9234	You are the biggest psycho I ever met.
9235	The important thing is I didn't imagine it.
9236	"Fourth Notice... ""90 Days Overdue""... ""We Break Thumbs""... Homer, what are we going to do?"
9237	"It's not just one magazine, Marge. They take hundreds of magazines, filter out the crap, and leave you with something that fits right in your front pocket."
9238	Evidence that I love my little girl.
9239	"Hey, I do more than TV. I had a one-man show on Broadway. That's who showed up -- one man! Long story short, I won a Drama Desk Award."
9240	I don't know. Dork farm? Who cares?
9241	"Bart, I need you to help me win the election."
9242	A blackout?! Every time Santa and I get together it's a disaster.
9243	Oh... I've got to find out more...
9244	"Well, if no one else jumped off the Empire State Building, would you not jump?"
9245	"Oh, what's the use? Burns would still find some way to take it from me."
9246	"Well, well, well! Our dashing young junior executive! You made a hollow mockery of our morning meeting, Simpson. I should fire you on the spot! But I'm not going to."
9247	"Wake up, Dad! Wake up! There was a burglar and he took my saxophone."
9248	Thanks for letting us stay with you.
9249	"Dad, I know we don't do a lot together, but helping you gain 61 pounds is something I want to be a part of."
9250	This is the last airline that would take us.
9251	"Homie, whatever it is, it's not happening."
9252	"It's the cat burglar! Please, don't kill me!"
9253	I must apologize for my husband.
9254	Moe? Wrecking Moe's bar?
9255	"Now, how 'bout the neck of my butt..."
9256	"Well, sir, she went crazy. Crazier than sleeping in on a Sunday."
9257	"Hey, I never refuse food from strangers."
9258	You've been working so hard lately. Maybe you should take a break.
9259	FIGHTING CRIME IS NOT MY CUP OF TEA...
9260	I was checking out the skirts at the local carnival when I first saw her...
9261	"And the Lord saw what he had made, and it was good."
9262	Henry The Fifth... Titus Andronicus...
9263	Son-of-a... Questions? Comments?
9264	"Y'ello, Oak Ridge? This is Springfield Nuclear. We need to order a... uh...T-437 Safety Command Console."
9265	Chloe is amazing -- even her serving bowl smells glamorous.
9266	"Well, live and learn."
9267	"Well, I'm all set. I'm gonna be following the latest designs from Modern Sandcastle magazine."
9268	"And you're ""interferon"" with our good time!"
9269	"Son, go get me a trash bag."
9270	"Hey, what happened to the tunes?"
9271	"So, you kids really love the Leader, huh? Even more than your parents?"
9272	Come on everybody. It makes you feel better.
9273	"Man, that dude does not like Bart."
9274	"No, Homer. It's mine."
9275	"Ah... Hello, there, uh... uh..."
9276	What about Romanian Krusty?
9277	"Absolutely. Our third Sunday of every month should be a pleasure, not a chore. Where's some place fun we can take Grampa next time?"
9278	"You're right. Bart, vacuum this floor!"
9279	"Bart, are you all right?"
9280	"All right, there's your enemy! Now hit him! Hit him! Let's go, next group! Martinez! Steinberg! O'Hara! Chang! Olajuwon! Herman!"
9281	"Hey, Dad, heard you swearing. Mind if I join in? Crap. Boobs. Crap."
9282	Simpson! I need a ride to the library.
9283	That's what he wore to church.
9284	$5000 for a computer and it can't handle a simple assignment.
9285	"Well, okay. I just wanted to make sure we weren't deluding ourselves."
9286	You sent me to the chair.
9287	Not the pony dream again!
9288	You mean like... an angel?!!
9289	"Really, Smithers, I'll be fine! I'm sure your replacement will be able to handle everything. Who is he, anyway?"
9290	Like a hog! Heh? What? What was that?
9291	Yes. I'd like to ask all the parents in Springfield who are concerned about this to write in and let the cartoon makers know how you feel. Thank you.
9292	No TV on the computer!
9293	"Artie, that's a sick idea. Come on, Homer, we're leaving."
9294	"Exactly. Now, what has two ears but can't hear?"
9295	"Ohhh, well, what won't make him logy?"
9296	"Thanks, Marge. You ruined my show. Now I'm going to give you a spoiler about our marriage: it's not great right now."
9297	"How about, ""Yes, it's me""."
9298	"Well, don't worry about me, Dad. It's not how it looks, it's how it sounds."
9299	Because you love the taste of my imaginary tea.
9300	"Oh, gotta go. Innocent!"
9301	"A religious clown thing, yes."
9302	"Dad, that junkie is your son!"
9303	"Please, please, please..."
9304	"Marge, I have a confession to make about this trip."
9305	"Oh, real original. Who did this?"
9306	WE HAVEN'T HAD A CIRCUS FIRE IN MONTHS!
9307	I knew you'd blow it. Now let me show you that mound.
9308	Oh my goodness. Kids! Homer! We're late for church! I'm glad I dressed last night.
9309	I love our court days.
9310	Forget it pal. I don't need your phoney baloney job. I'll take your money but I'm not gonna plow your driveway.
9311	Here. Tell me how my stocks did yesterday.
9312	Uh... I'll Etch-A-Sketch it for you.
9313	My name is Marge Bouvier. I'm here about your ad.
9314	Left! Right! Stab! Stab! Stab!
9315	"Checking accounts aren't really for children, Bart."
9316	Don't be mad at Homer. I was the one who cut the rope.
9317	"Doctor, if you just talked to him for five minutes without mentioning our son, Bart, you'd see how sane he is."
9318	Check it out! It's on TV!
9319	I didn't take a bath today and I may not take one tomorrow.
9320	"Hm, sounds like a lie, but what could he be covering up?"
9321	...so when Bob collapsed in the courtroom...
9322	"No, I can't. C'mon, let's go."
9323	"Kids, I don't want you drinking any more milk. Ever."
9324	"Ooo, Burly, you're insatiable."
9325	"Mmm... I paid a pretty penny for this pretty penny, but it was worth it."
9326	I'm so sick of names!
9327	...Onnneee... onnneee...
9328	"Of course. It was, uh... some kind of a... light rail."
9329	"So, did you write your dream on the index card of fate?"
9330	The looming kablooey.
9331	"Well, Moe's getting a big screen TV in February. Just in time for the Pro Bowl. Maybe this time my beloved blue shirts will win."
9332	"He's a good boy now, and he's getting better, and sometimes even the best sheep stray from the flock and need to be hugged extra hard."
9333	"All right, Helen, if I'm not wanted, I'll leave."
9334	"Oh, I can't wait. Look, Marge, I had a scorecard printed up at that all-night scorecard place."
9335	"Lisa, see what we mean when we say you're too smart for your own good?"
9336	I know we built a secret passage in here somewhere.
9337	"You're all right, Stupid Flanders. You're all right."
9338	Whoa. That's a bit of a woo-hoo. Indeed.
9339	Poor Homer. This world was never meant for one as beautiful as you.
9340	"Hey, fellas, let's go shoot some bad guys."
9341	"No, I'm talking to you, at this great party!"
9342	Watch what happens when I spill this blue liquid.
9343	Rise my pretties! Find our enemies and capture their image in your filmy fortress!
9344	"Y'know, our bible study group is going to the Holy Land next month. I'd like you and your family to come as my guests."
9345	"Excuse us, Rabbi Krustofsky?"
9346	Unguarded stuffff...!
9347	Where's my burrito? Where's my burrito? Where's my burrito?
9348	Oh my God! The prophecy is being fulfilled.
9349	Good Lord! That canary was supposed to be my pigeon. I need to find a patsy quick!
9350	"You can strangle Bart, but you can't strangle your humiliation."
9351	"Howdilly hey, Camper Bart. Ready for today's meeting?"
9352	She's got a set of lungs on her.
9353	"Hi, guys. Whatcha lookin' at?"
9354	The Senior Olympics? That's what I was supposed to remember?!
9355	I wonder if I could change Nelson...
9356	Do - you - hear - a - noise?
9357	Springfield squash -- the most fibrous variety of yellow squash!
9358	Who decided that the electrons we produce can't stand for something greater?
9359	"You know, I'm pretty excited about this far-out dinner. Maybe I'll like it."
9360	Then you might wanna close your windows before the sun hits Diaper Hill.
9361	"Dad, make Bart wash his hand."
9362	No problem. Why don't you go inside and stir your flubber while I get to work.
9363	I will never... know... the score!
9364	But it's only been one night.
9365	"Son, let this music take you to a time when girls were girls and a Hershey bar was as thick as a phone book -- I'm sick of this song!"
9366	"Um, so... tell me about your day."
9367	"I hate to rain on your parade, lady, but this is my grave. Hey, wait a minute... Mom?"
9368	It wasn't even my place!
9369	Now that kinda attitude's not gonna get your house back.
9370	"Yeah, I'd like to speak to a Mr. Tabooger. First name, Ollie."
9371	The cereal on the bottom gets soggy.
9372	So... when can we go back in our house?
9373	It's no use kidding myself. I'm having an ethical crisis.
9374	"That's right! Hope you like your present. And a-one, and a-two, and a one, two, three, four --"
9375	No. She's sleeping with
9376	"Well, thought bubble Marge said we should put it in a college fund for Lisa."
9377	"Beautiful, aren't they?"
9378	Your father wasted his whole life being married to your mother and having you. We've got to find him a boyfriend before it's too late!
9379	Homer! Lisa is receiving the Student of the Millennium Award at school.
9380	Did you ever get the parody songs I sent you?
9381	"Ha-ho sweetie, being second ain't the worst thing that can happen. Look at poor old Jasper over there."
9382	So? Just gimme some drugs and surgery.
9383	"We need the money, and my life is pretty boring. Last week some Jehovah's Witnesses came to the door and I wouldn't let them leave. They snuck away when I went in the kitchen to get more lemonade."
9384	SHE COULDN'T POSSIBLY DO WORSE!
9385	"I staked out the alley and befriended the garbage man who took it. Then he gave it to a local theater company, who used it in the first unsuccessful version of ""Mamma Mia."" In a bankruptcy sale, it was bought by a young couple. That couple right there!"
9386	That's amazing! ...And darling.
9387	Can't we just go upstairs?
9388	Wow! They'll never let us show that again. Not in a million years!
9389	"It was such an honor to be on the Walk of Fame. I mean, there we were with Hollywood royalty, like Milton Berle and Nelson Mandela."
9390	"All right family, who can guess what's different about dinner tonight?"
9391	Wha-wha-what are you doing?
9392	It sure is great to look down my nose at everybody again. Mind if I waggle my finger a little bit?
9393	Ow! The ol' hot spoon. But why?
9394	"I didn't do it! Mom, you believe me, don't you?"
9395	"Burns needs some serious boosta-fazoo. Right, Dad? Dad? Homer?"
9396	"I don't get it, Homer. You're a millionaire and you've got all the babes you want. Why aren't you living it up in your palace in Europe?"
9397	Mama Bear said 'I'm sure Sister Bear will come to her senses.'
9398	"A credit card? Oh, I knew you were up to no good."
9399	I have hair! Look! Look!
9400	"/ Oh! Breathe, Homie, breathe!"
9401	Me too. And you know what? I'm afraid you might... change back.
9402	Blimp Assassin Three.
9403	Here you go. Make sure you get into every crevice.
9404	You're one of the major...
9405	"I have a plan to get to the top, but I have to do some pretty rotten things to get there. I'm not sure I could look at myself in the mirror, or any highly-polished metal."
9406	Mom! Bart's swearing!
9407	"Don't gloat, Homer. You know, Bart, when I was your age, the one thing I wanted more than anything in the world was a Child-sized Electric Lightbulb Oven. My parents wouldn't give me the money, so I went to my sisters, Patty and Selma..."
9408	Why don't you just cut the paint out of her hair?
9409	Bart can take my place at the plant!
9410	"Oh my God, I'm holding back the team. But our marriage is based on curling. What am I gonna do?"
9411	No. Just plain neighbor.
9412	"I'm alive! I'm alive. And I couldn't be happier. From this day forward, I vow to live life to its fullest!"
9413	"Well, I've got a confession to make. This right arm... it's not mine."
9414	"Now, everyone relax and pretend we're about to be hit by a soft brick wall."
9415	Uh-oh. I slipped on some blood. I'm totally vulnerable to a full-body jukebox slam.
9416	I am so -ing embarrassed.
9417	You call this a bicameral legislature?
9418	"You know what you should serve, Marge? More of these lamb chops. These are the best ever."
9419	You mean all white with pink eyes?
9420	"Wait, wait, wait. You're putting us in a new school?! What about my friends?"
9421	"Here comes my commercial. In six, five, four..."
9422	"Jumping on the bed. But I never disobeyed my parents, till I married you."
9423	"Mom, can you tell me the story of how I got my saxophone and not have it turn into a story about Bart!"
9424	Stop! You are in violation of the Model U.N. Charter!
9425	"So you see, we can't let Jailbird fry."
9426	Um... I'm also returning this kitten calendar.
9427	"Well, I think we lost 'em."
9428	You're right. Let's bury them at sea.
9429	"It's your plan, from ""Braveheart."" Your army mooned the enemy until they could take no more and surrendered."
9430	"Although this millennium is still young, I feel it is time to award this giant trophy paid for with your healthcare cuts..."
9431	"I know, I used to think of Moe as a scabby, dead-eyed hunchback. But now that I've gotten to know him, we kind of bonded."
9432	"Ready for breakfast, Doctor Smith?"
9433	"Oh, I ain't mad, and I never will be again -- thanks to your wonderful, wonderful..."
9434	"Oh good. Marge remarried after I died. Wait a minute, I'm not dead. What's goin' on?"
9435	"Bart, I'd like you to read this copy of ""Johnny Tremain."" It's a book I read as a girl."
9436	"Mom, did you like horses when you were my age? 'Cause I heard--"
9437	"Homie? Well, look at you..."
9438	Hello children! I bring you love!
9439	"Oh sorry, I wasn't listening. I was checking out my reflection in this yellow water. Lookin' good."
9440	Can't I even have privacy here?!
9441	Go back to your day spas!
9442	"You've won this round, but..."
9443	"I know, but they're not gonna waste a whole Saturday inside."
9444	"Don't worry, Bart. It seems like every week something odd happens to the Simpsons. My advice is to ride it out, make an occasional smart-alec quip and by next week we'll be back to where we started from, ready for another wacky adventure."
9445	Why do you always wait until Christmas Eve to do your shopping? The crowds are just beastly.
9446	You gave away my room!
9447	Two sets of twins and a triplet!
9448	"If there's a body in here, we'll drag it up."
9449	"Lou, he's gotta get over it. I miss Shamrock Shakes, but they ain't comin' back till March!"
9450	Hey Flanders? Can your God do that?
9451	I'll have one of those.
9452	"If it's clear and yellow, you've got juice there, fellow! If it's tangy and brown, you're in Cider Town! Now there's two exceptions, and it gets kinda tricky here..."
9453	I did not do that prank.
9454	Wow. You're really asking for my help?
9455	"Cause I didn't want you to wreck your life. You got the brains and the talent to go as far as you want. And when you do, I'll be right there to borrow money."
9456	Look Marge! It's just what you want. Me spending the day with Muggsy.
9457	You leave Maggie to me.
9458	"Sure! You're gonna be all ""I'm-so-stupid! I'm-so-stupid! I'm-so-stupid!"""
9459	Seems like everywhere I look people are enjoying knives.
9460	"What's wrong, sweetie?"
9461	"But Amber, I can change!"
9462	I feel validated by that.
9463	"Honey, animals don't feel death. That was proved by the scientists at Black Angus."
9464	"Well, why can't I hang out at the bar all day? My wife doesn't wanna be with me."
9465	"Really? Really? Uh-huh, all right."
9466	No. My husband is... at church.
9467	That flattens my soda pop! You're on!
9468	"I don't get you! You're hot, you're cold... What is your deal?!"
9469	"Hey, guys! Sign my cast? Sign my cast? Guys...?"
9470	And I'll take up smoking and give that up.
9471	"Phew, that was close."
9472	"My Lord, we Americans love queens, be they homecoming or Dairy. This woman, however, is an imposter."
9473	"Maman, please pass ze baguette."
9474	I can't believe he's paying us a thousand bucks to pretend it's the seventies.
9475	"Heh, heh! My finest hour! And Marge wasn't even here to see it."
9476	"Hey, don't blame me -- I didn't even take the test."
9477	"We're still not close. Boy, this is gonna be an all-night brain buster. Better drink some coffee."
9478	Great. And now my Dad can notarize.
9479	"For every one of my cartoons that you erase, I rip up a family vacation photo. And just so you know I mean business, here's an ear!"
9480	I think there's really something wrong with Santa's Little Helper. He was up barking all night and dug up the back yard worse than ever.
9481	"I've been so bored since we moved here, I've found myself drinking a glass of wine every day. I know doctors say you should drink a glass and a half, but I just can't drink that much."
9482	I KNEW RIGHT THEN THAT IT WAS L-U-V...
9483	"Let me get this straight: you want me to do my kids' show for adults? They're gonna want F-bombs and all I can give 'em is ""ka-ka"" and ""ta-tas."""
9484	I didn't gasp like that until I was eighteen!
9485	"Come on, come on. Let's go."
9486	"Aw, Lisa. You tried your best."
9487	The Christians changed their calendar and ridiculed those who didn't.
9488	I have every right to be on that jury even though I got there because I'm sleeping with the head of the festival.
9489	Just a quick game of hacky-sack.
9490	I can't be the guy who killed everybody's fun. That's Skinner's job.
9491	Is there no place for the man with a 105 IQ?
9492	"Ooh, he's controlling me with my hair, using me to cook a delicious sole meuniere with a celery root puree and carrots Vichy."
9493	Microatia? That's twelve thousand miles away.
9494	Howdy. And thanks for not recoiling in horror.
9495	"Well, I guess I should explain. Not long ago, it was my day to take care of the baby, so I was out in the forest, hiding."
9496	"Oh, you should've seen their faces, honey. Now I know how Bob Stupak feels."
9497	"Oh, I'm glad you're keepin' busy."
9498	You told me he was at culinary school!
9499	Got any more tall tales?
9500	Dad wasn't even around on Christmas morning when I actually got to meet Santa Claus. Some father... Wait a minute.
9501	"Honey, are ya sure ya wanna be Mrs. Montgomery Burns? Wouldn't ya rather be Mrs. Abraham J. Simpson?"
9502	"Olive oil? ""Asparagus?"" If your mother wasn't so fancy, we could shop at the gas station like normal people."
9503	That was Led Zeppelin.
9504	"Okay, kids. It's time to..."
9505	"You're not supposed to go to the bathroom without washing your hands, either."
9506	It's kind of embarrassing...
9507	"Good boy, Mojo. Now, bring 'em down and I'll give you one."
9508	I'm tired of livin' once.
9509	Summer opportunities.
9510	"You're crazy if you think you're gonna get away with this, lady. You can't --"
9511	What if they parody it on Mad TV?
9512	I might grease the wheels of justice with some cookies.
9513	Come on. There's no need for that baba-ma-bushka.
9514	Who cares? He's dishin' out the dirt.
9515	"I don't think so, son."
9516	"My hat's off to you, Red. You're a true American hero. And you did it with style and dignity and... Hey, you're not breathing. Don't people usually breathe?"
9517	La la la la la la la. Nothing left. La la la... la... la.
9518	That was me. Some very un-cool people put me in here.
9519	"MANY PEOPLE IN THIS TOWN / SING LIKE WE DO / THERE'S MISTER BURNS, THERE'S KRUSTY, AND EVEN APU."
9520	"You're asking the wrong guy, Milhouse. They all look alike to me. Now let's go whip donuts at old people"
9521	The light from your eyes could guide a ship at sea.
9522	"That's Maggie again, Grampa."
9523	"Well, if it isn't Little Miss ""I'm not wasting my life anymore."" Which he is."
9524	"You're right, Marge -- I guess I should look for roofers at poetry slams and yoga retreats."
9525	Everyone likes you. You're a wonderful person.
9526	Someone finally took one!
9527	"The other thing about TV dinners -- you don't have leftovers, you have reruns."
9528	"Hey, Milhouse. How's the lemonade business?"
9529	No more questions. I work my butt off to feed you four kids and all you do I -- what?
9530	"People stop! We can't give up our dental plan! Lenny, without the dental plan, you wouldn't have that diamond in your tooth."
9531	Scratchy is getting a haircut. Then Itchy -- the barber -- chops Scratchy's head off with a razor!
9532	I wanna see Wilmington!
9533	It means these two fabulous babes are staying for dinner.
9534	Now that's the kinda nagging I can live with.
9535	"Yeah, maybe it'll wear off. Like his interest in C.B. radio."
9536	"Well, I think it's wonderful that your father has fallen in love with my mother."
9537	Mornin' kids! I made your lunches. They're on the table.
9538	"Twenty? Homer, I paid three hundred dollars for this just last year."
9539	"Yes, but I'm afraid the forces of history have changed wrestling, perhaps forever."
9540	This school has everything I ever wanted.
9541	"Well, I couldn't be happier. I'm the second coolest kid on earth."
9542	"I said, pipe down, Amtrak."
9543	I'm gettin' out in two weeks. Why would I want to break out with you?
9544	"Let's sacrifice him to our god! C'mon, we did it all the time in the thirties."
9545	No excuses! Just do it!
9546	"Aww, Dad, I just got a little twinge in my heart."
9547	At the carnival? Cool!
9548	Sometimes I think about gettin' on a bus and never comin' back.
9549	I learned about it in here.
9550	You're gonna be my breakfast English sausage.
9551	"Mom, these are at least two sizes too big."
9552	"What?! Lis, you're smart. Why would you give me a book? 'Cause it's easy to wrap?"
9553	"I can't run, I'm wearing flip-flops!"
9554	"Who cares?! Milhouse, I'll be right there! Sorry Maggie, game's over."
9555	Chapter One: The RubyStone in the Door-Portal. Are you asleep yet?
9556	"Well, not literally. But in a way, isn't he everyone's son? For you see, that little ""hell-raiser"" is the spawn of every shrieking commercial, every brain-rotting soda pop, every teacher who cares less about young minds than about cashing their big, fat paychecks. No, Bart's not to blame. You can't create a monster and then whine when he stomps on a few buildings. I'm Lisa Simpson."
9557	"Krusty, this camp was a nightmare. They fed us gruel, they forced us to make wallets for export, and one of the campers was eaten by a bear."
9558	"Mom, even Milhouse has a cell phone! Your son is lamer than Milhouse! What does that say about you?!"
9559	"Hmmm... Hey, Milhouse. Wanna have some fun?"
9560	"You wanna win this election? Then from now on, you do exactly what I say."
9561	"Here's some more chocolate curls, gun buddies."
9562	What have you got so far?
9563	"Hey, Krusty's in an opera, here in Rome! He can save our lives! Come on, let's go!"
9564	"Well, that's a relief."
9565	"Homer, do you think you could show just the slightest bit of reverence?"
9566	"Yeah. Among other things, apes can't get into heaven."
9567	That's easy for you to say. You've never had to be thin and focused.
9568	And now you're the most elegant and popular woman in the world!
9569	"Marge, well, let me be honest with you."
9570	Now nothing will stop you from taking on all of Shakespeare's greatest roles: King Lear... Hamlet...
9571	"I was thinking that while your father and Lisa watch the game, it might be fun if the two of us went clothes shopping."
9572	"Homer, this is yours."
9573	"All right, we're breaking early tonight, class. For tomorrow, you should read pages seven through eighteen in Lisa's diary."
9574	There's all kinds of ways to get the public on your side. Bob Dylan wrote songs. Cesar Chavez staged hunger strikes.
9575	On the way home we could stop and get your favorite treat: ice...cream!
9576	"Oh, this is gonna be so great."
9577	"Say, Cool Dude, can I play, too?"
9578	"You sold us out, Conover!"
9579	It's Mr. Smithers. He's calling for you.
9580	"See that? I started to do like a little arabesque, but then I just fully went for it and pulled off the demi-entrechant. Not that I'm into that kind of thing."
9581	"Oh... well, yeah, the ointments, um..."
9582	"Man, you're good with the tools when you want to be."
9583	"Are you really so disappointed the world didn't end, just so you could be proven right?"
9584	"Oh. Well, that makes sense. What'll they think of next? Blue pages?"
9585	"Doctor, why is this happening to me?"
9586	"Ah, my new watering hole."
9587	"Marge, tell her how I don't push Ned around."
9588	"Aww, a gift from my favorite crustacean."
9589	"Aah, the life of a frog. That's the life for me."
9590	You don't have a factory.
9591	"Mom, Dad threw his beer can at the Miracle Gro guy on TV. Can I recycle it?"
9592	Oh my goodness gracious!
9593	"Hey, vote Simpson... Hi... Nice to see ya... Heh, thanks for comin' out... Keep puttin' on weight, huh? Lenny, my man."
9594	I FELL IN LOVE WITH YOU / HEART AND SOUL...
9595	"Um, well, sir, it happened 25 years before I was born."
9596	Put up my house? But I just paid it off... what would Marge say?
9597	"Marge, how can anyone be mad at himself? It's impossible. Watch."
9598	"Quiet, honey, you don't know how big this government is. It goes all the way to the president."
9599	Relax. What is mind? No matter. What is matter? Never mind.
9600	"So, how many more weeks do you have off?"
9601	"You are the shining light that gets me through my darkest hours. For further communication I will require more beans. I love you, baby."
9602	"Well, despite all that, today's gonna be fun, Dad! Will there be lots of other girls there?"
9603	"Hey, you with the scarf! Stop skywriting!"
9604	What? But you don't know how to bowl!... whoops.
9605	I guess I'm more powerful than God now.
9606	"Best Thanksgiving ever, eh boy?"
9607	"Wait a minute, you little cheater. You're not going anywhere until you tell me what a kwyjibo is."
9608	"Crimes... ""Kill"" ""Holy""... ""Sage""..."
9609	But it's a single bed.
9610	Sgt. Skinner was a hero. He risked capture many times behind enemy lines.
9611	"Yeah, I knew you'd think it's dumb--"
9612	I wasn't thinking that! Carl's our good friend.
9613	That was just confusing.
9614	"Pinball, eh? I've always wanted to try this."
9615	"Jenny, I can't take the pressure anymore. I have to come clean. I'm only pretending to be good..."
9616	"Hitler, North Dakota?"
9617	Have you been awake all night?
9618	"Oh sorry, son. I wanted you to bring me the stack of tiles from the top shelf. Hey, Ray's here!"
9619	"So Bart, how's your big school presentation coming along?"
9620	SOLD SEPARATELY / SOMETIMES I FEEL LIKE I'VE BEEN SOLD SEPARATELY / BUT OUT-OF-THE-BOX I FIND YOU...
9621	"Wh-- th-- that's crazy talk. You're crazy, Marge. Get off the road."
9622	"Half an hour to show time, your ugliness."
9623	"Because... Oh. Oh, okay, okay. What should we do?"
9624	"Whoa, this place sure has changed since Dizznee bought the rights to Cosmic Wars."
9625	Free at last! Free at last!
9651	"Homer, Bill Gates is here."
9652	"Kids, you'd better take your last look at Uncle Artie."
9653	"There I was, having a great time in the back yard, when without warning, I was abducted by aliens."
9654	Dynamite?! They are terrorists! Must leave quietly.
9655	"Lisa, honey, do you need any help with your homework?"
9656	"Oh, there's an original sentiment."
9657	Mmm... okay. Just be careful.
9658	"Oh, oh, oh, I get it. Put on a big show for the cameras."
9659	"All right, I know what to do. I'll dump her like she's never been dumped before, then we'll go right back to being friends."
9660	"QUIET, BIET, DIET, ZIET, FIET..."
9661	Just start nature-walking. See if I show up.
9662	So we're not going to Black Angus.
9663	La-la-la! I'm eight years old!
9664	"Wow, we must really be flying high. Those people down there look all tiny and blurry... just like the inside of a cataract."
9665	"Oh, that sounds too complicated."
9666	Now it's headed for the church.
9667	"Look, Dad had to get cured some time. There's nothing we can do about it."
9668	"Thank you, Lord, for delivering us from Reverend Lovejoy!"
9669	"Chief Wiggum, you've been around. You don't trust Sideshow Bob, do you?"
9670	You'd probably get a better deal at a mall back home.
9671	"I really appreciate your taking such an interest in me, Dad."
9672	"Okey-dokel. Hey, why don't you and your family come over for a barbecue tomorrow?"
9673	"This one's a little gay, isn't it?"
9674	"I really do like working with you, Dad. Will you keep helping me?"
9675	He's targeting the nuclear plant?!
9676	"There's Butt-crack Barry, Merle Values, Reverend Racist and Andy Dick."
9677	"There was a bunch of old paint cans in their garage, though."
9678	"Perfect. You're our TV critic. Ralph, what about you?"
9679	Once there was a robot named Todd...
9680	"I'm so proud of you, Homie. It's like you're Kid Rock and I'm Pamela Anderson Lee Rock."
9681	That's backwards for so-so.
9682	Could we hurry this up? I am really uncomfortable being a girl in this store.
9683	The father of the boy who doesn't win has to mow the lawn in his wife's Sunday dress.
9684	"Oh, wait. That's Lisa's nose."
9685	Please let it be a bear that did this.
9686	Flanders? What are you doin' here?
9687	"Or, we could hand out teachers' home phone numbers -- Â­so kids can call them whenever they have questions."
9688	"Ooh, let's go to the waterpark. My ten-year ban ended yesterday."
9689	"The disputed islands lie here, off the coast of Argentina."
9690	Why you wearing it now?
9691	"To get the key I have to lick through a lollipop? Oh, how awful."
9692	"Eh, I'm sick of this Tarzan movie."
9693	"But that's not true, Bart saw him at the Builder's Barn."
9694	You twisted old monster!!
9695	"If I said no the first time, what makes you think I'm gonna say yes the second time?"
9696	And how did you know I wouldn't be there?
9697	"No, no, no. A person, you know who I mean."
9698	All right. Just wake me up.
9699	Did you see that? I did the deed! Open up!
9700	I told her not to go into one of those.
9701	"Hey, what's the big deal about going to some building every Sunday? I mean, isn't God everywhere?"
9702	Ashes to ashes... dust to dust... we've gotta go fight some robots.
9703	"Oh, thank God! Just a dream!"
9704	"Well, my faithful dog was bringing me my shoes and they fell apart in his mouth."
9705	"Hey, hands off my pickle."
9706	Great! We're all going to New York!
9707	"Gil, I've been meaning to tell you, you're fired."
9708	So how do you afford such a sweet pad?
9709	"It's not mistletoe, just cherries and lettuce!"
9710	"Uh... if YOU did it, sir?..."
9711	Ha! Just like you to forget that I might want some.
9712	I don't have an inside voice!
9713	"Yeah, but what are ya gonna do?"
9714	"You just don't understand football, Marge."
9715	"Wow, the graphics are amazing. That ball almost seems real!"
9716	"Mom, why are you so worried about money?"
9717	"Or so I thought. At the last moment, Smithers, drunk as a lemur, lurched out of the darkness and fired."
9718	Try me. Sometimes it helps to talk.
9719	I think I just got dumped.
9720	"Isn't it nice up here? What are you thinking, Nelson?"
9721	"That's all I can stands, I can't stands no more. I'm gonna get you outta there myself."
9722	"Find the golden giraffe, and we'll send you and your family to Africa."
9723	"Now, there's something I've wanted to do for a long time."
9724	"Oh, Lisa, honey, I tracked down those old newspapers for your history project."
9725	Come on! This train goes right through Springfield!
9726	"Yeah, but I gotta warn you that this thing is ee ... Yeah, that's what it is. Wanna try it? Heh, heh, heh."
9727	"Merry Christmas, Homie. I think you're really gonna like this."
9728	"It wasn't all bad. As part of the settlement, her funeral was air conditioned."
9729	"Moe, what happened to your eponymous tavern?"
9730	"Hey, come on guys. Quit being so grabby."
9731	"Uh, Mr. Burns... Uh, Mr. Burns..."
9732	How do you know my name?
9733	Did you just wink at me?
9734	I didn't. I got secondhand wasted from smooching your father. So not a peep out of anyone till the Fiesta Bowl!
9735	"Hey, I hear ya, buddy."
9736	"Oh, Bart. I am so glad everything's okay."
9737	"Didja hear that, Pengy? Forty dollars!"
9738	I think he'd be cool with it.
9739	Hey everybody! How you doin'? Look at me! I'm Homer Simpson! Heh...heh.
9740	"C'mon, I'll give you a piggy-back ride, oops, I mean a veggie-back ride home."
9741	"I wanna hear the Glenn Miller Orchestra, and I wanna see cops beatin' up hippies!"
9742	"And now a word from my God, our sponsor."
9743	You're not as stupid as you look... or sound... or our best testing indicates.
9744	"While the boys are gone, we'll sell all their useless junk and replace it with knickknacks and curios."
9745	"Well, sir, I hate to be a Suspicious Aloysius on you, but did you steal my air conditioner?"
9746	Sure. That means she wants to talk in private. It's probably about you.
9747	"He won't escape, sir."
9748	"Good luck, Mr. Burns. And if you get in trouble, I wrote some jokes about how white people are different from black people."
9749	It's great to be indoors with my family.
9750	"Well, beer... we've had some great times."
9751	Say... has he ever thought about a career in law enforcement?
9752	"So Mr. Burns, you're saying my Dad has gone insane and thinks he's a god and broken off all contact with the outside world?"
9753	Use only in a well ventilated area.
9754	Yeah. The sun is still out.
9755	They found a switchblade in my locker.
9756	"Heavenly Father, I..."
9757	Now let it unfurl in your stomach.
9758	"No, Dad, they're the opposite."
9759	"You're not a god, Homer."
9760	"You've got it all wrong, my friend. Once you see it my way, you'll understand that being hated is the greatest feeling in the world."
9761	"Team up with me, boys, and we'll go for the biggest honey pot of 'em all."
9762	"Yes. He can take a simple, everyday thing like eating a bicycle and make it funny."
9763	Bingo? That's my favorite game. I just can't remember what to yell out when you win.
9764	A tramp steamer! That's perfect!
9765	"Well, you certainly captured the moment. Hmmm ."
9766	I think I'd like to finish my sentence: and years.
9767	"I'm number one! I beat my son! Victory is mine, so kiss my behind!"
9768	"Bart picks one of the smoothies and drinks it -- maybe he had the broccoli, maybe he didn't. No one knows, so neither of you has given in, and this horrible impasse can come to an end."
9769	Can I be Johnny Undercover?
9770	"Katie, you were the first victim of the Buzz Cola trap door. Fall into the flavor hole!"
9771	"Oh, he wants that corn so much!"
9772	"I've seen people activate this machine a thousand times. Doesn't seem to be any trick to it... Let's see... Smithers... ""S-M-I-T-H-E-R-S"". Success! It's ringing!"
9773	Did you say beer or deer?
9774	Which are you saying is dead? Our marriage or our batteries?
9775	"Dad, they're trying to kill us!"
9776	"Dad, you're eating too much! I'm worried about your health! I don't wanna lose you!"
9777	Election night is so exciting. I'm on pins and needles.
9778	All we need now is a computer guy...
9779	First go make me five pans of brownies.
9780	Not compared to this.
9781	You! You did this to me!
9782	"Homie, I want another baby."
9783	"Um, excuse me, sir. I already know how not to hit a guy. Can we break out the nunchucks?"
9784	"Forget it, kid. You're too small to go to the Super Bowl."
9785	"Yeah, that's what I'm talkin' about! Those real people out there who buy their coffee from the mini-mart, and grab enough sugar packs for a week! Honest, hardworking, sugar-stealing Americans!"
9786	Oh my God. He's dead?
9787	Hall and Oates? What's going on here?!
9788	"I'm sorry I missed dinner, honey. We still have time to catch a movie. That can be romantic."
9789	I'm getting' closer. It's just within reach.
9790	"Ooo, looks like Tick-Tock is telling us it's time for..."
9791	What can I say? Maggie and I share a special bond.
9792	"Well, I'm flunkin' math, and the other day I was a little attracted to Milhouse."
9793	"Hey, Lisa said she was--"
9794	"Uh, sir, ah, about that, uh, ah, that kiss. I-hi-hi, I hope you understand it was merely a sign of my respect."
9795	And I'll always be grateful. But it's time you started treating me with respect.
9796	"No, I'm kind of embarrassed about it."
9797	"If she started dinner three minutes earlier, we wouldn't be in this mess!"
9798	You're a great mom. You were always there for Bart with love and support. His acting out was probably caused by negative reinforcement.
9799	"Well, I open a lot of crazy things when I'm drunk, but I don't think so."
9800	"Dad! Dad, a little help?"
9801	"Oh, so you don't like it when I drink. What other secrets have you been hoarding to use against me?"
9802	"Uh-oh, the Germans are comin' to get me. Oh, don't let the Germans come after me... Oh no, the Germans are coming after me. Oh, no, they're so big and strong..."
9803	Fat Tony is a cancer on this fair city. He is the cancer and I am the... uh... ... what cures cancer?
9804	"that's the spirit. Ready or not, nature here we come!"
9805	It's a game. We're not hurtin' anybody.
9806	Get that cat out of the way!
9807	And I threw out all your old comics!
9808	"Oh, I am so proud of you."
9809	Any exposure to unsanitary conditions?
9810	"Son, let's forget all about that drug thing. Why don't you just come down and have some taffy?"
9811	"My brother's using worms but I who feel that tranquility far outweighs the actual catching of fish, am using nothing."
9812	"Are you all right, Homer?"
9813	"Good evening, Principal Skinner and welcome to our home."
9814	"Oh, why did I get this Lego shirt?"
9815	Maggie? She's in her crib.
9816	I just wish she hadn't died thinking I hated her.
9817	"That was a delicious meal, Cookie. What do we do with our garbage?"
9818	"She was the prettiest girl I'd ever seen. Uh... until I met your mother, who made that girl look like a Godzilla made of garbage."
9819	It's a little something I whipped up in shop. Mostly latex. What're you doing out here?
9820	Vuvuzela me out of here!
9821	"That lying , rail-splitting , theater-going freak!"
9822	"No. No Lisa, they're just... sleeping. Upside down. And inside out."
9823	"Well hi, Lurleen. We were just talking about you. Uh... I think I can come over. Let me ask my wife."
9824	"Oh God, I'm gonna be sick!"
9825	"Fine, I'll just discuss heavenly matters. So, how's Maude Flanders doin' up there? She playin' the field? Ooh... yeah, really? All those guys? Amen."
9826	"I gave up anger forever. From now on, I'm into candles, soft music and horse tranquilizers."
9827	Smithers... you must believe!
9828	"Aw, that's your answer to everything. Look at my life. I'm talkin' to a monkey and a -- I don't know what the hell you are."
9829	"Those two hairs were what was left of my youth, Moe."
9830	"Lisa, I'd rather tell you a different story. How your father and I first met and fell in love."
9831	"Hey, that is wonderful, sweetie. I'm gonna read it just as soon as I finish what I'm doing here."
9832	WE'LL BE DEAD...SHOT THROUGH THE HEAD
9833	Would you rather tell Maude the truth?
9834	"Well, we have to run. I'm sure you kids will work things out. Good night!"
9835	"Wow, Dad was so cute as a baby."
9836	"Hey Dad, maybe this'll cheer you up. Why you little..."
9837	"Lisa, I know a song that will cheer you up. THERE ONCE WAS AN UGLY DUCKLING..."
9838	"Ow, this rug is hard on my knees. Ow, this rug is hard on my knees. Ow, this rug is hard on my knees."
9839	Cruciverbalists from far and wide have gathered here for a no-holds-barred test of skill.
9840	"Dad, look, I made fish sticks. They're burned on the outside, but they're frozen on the inside so it balances out."
9841	All right. Stay calm. Remember your training.
9842	Now you've got no choice.
9843	Thank God you're okay!
9844	"Yeah, but can he do this?"
9845	BART! Get out of the Spirit of St. Louis!
9846	Can I lick your fingers? Meet me at the mail slot.
9847	"Well, I don't usually... well, just this once."
9848	No. I mean a vacation by myself.
9849	"Kids, your father and I are going through a really tough time right now. And I don't know what's going to happen, but just remember that both your mom and your dad love you very very much."
9850	"What is he, blind and deaf?"
9851	"Sir, the N.R.C. is here for a surprise inspection!"
9852	"This is great! I'm finally gonna find out how I ruined my family! Strap me in, nerd!"
9853	Are we taking the new Lexus to Aunt Patty and Selma's funeral today?
9854	Stupid Bart. Bagpipes getting down with an octopus... that's classic.
9855	I bought my lunch at the gas station.
9856	"Hmmm, eight dollars a pound... times say, oh, five pounds... is, ummm... let's see, how many pounds in a gallon? Oh, I can't afford that."
9857	"Wow, Governor's Island looks so insignificant from up here."
9858	I'd stab somebody for a pickle.
9859	"Hey! Now that old man Peterson's off our backs, let's have some fun!"
9860	"More like ""at your six-pack,"" am I right? It's okay if you need to take a little nap."
9861	I'll repress the rage I'm feeling.
9862	Who gave you all this money?
9863	"You kids do eat a lot of sugar. But at least Homer can have a nice, healthy grapefruit."
9864	All right. I'll do it for my kids.
9865	"Have you read them all? Okay, good."
9866	I guess we have to move on.
9867	"You know what, Mr. Burns? I'm never comin' back. My son's making so much cash in the T-shirt game, that I don't have to work another day in my life -- assuming my health does not deteriorate as I age."
9868	You live in this building?
9869	"Even better, I'll ask him for my job back."
9870	Can you find anything you like in this bed?
9871	"I keep telling you, the ability to add two-digit numbers is not witchcraft!"
9872	Now you do it for me.
9873	He's got the tape of Kent Brockman picking his nose!
9874	Yeah... Pinchy?... Pinchy?!... Oh... Pinchy!!!
9875	"Oh Maggie, I love you from the tip of your toes to the bow on your hair with the red blinking light. God bless your mother for making you with me."
9876	Telegram for Lisa Simpson.
9877	"Luckily I've prepared for this, so I'm not too worried."
9878	"Eh? Eh? Come on, I thought you Euro-jerks loved unfunny comedy."
9879	Bart and I will explore the attic until we find their source.
9880	Ooh. I don't feel so good.
9881	"Shut up, it's a serious problem."
9882	"Hey, I can't go in there!"
9883	"Well, it has been a week."
9884	"A ""Forget-Me-Shot?"" Never heard of it."
9885	"Peace, my people. All shall be looked up. Let's see, most clothespins: swallowed, inserted... here we go, clipped to face and neck. One hundred and sixteen."
9886	"I'd like to declare bankruptcy, please!"
9887	"Oh, don't worry. You'll be sleeping in this beautiful new doghouse. Target date: January, 2007."
9888	"Dad and Ned Flanders friends? What's next... ""A's"" on Bart's report card?"
9889	"Yeah, but what can you do?"
9890	"Yeah, Dad! You can be the world's laziest stunt organizer!"
9891	I'unno. He was dead when I found him.
9892	"All my daughter ever did was tell people to think for themselves. I may be her father, but when I grow up, I wanna be just like her. Except still a dude."
9893	"Now, this is a picture of your enemy, Todd Flanders. Every day I want you to spend fifteen minutes staring at it and concentrating on how much you hate him and how glorious it will be when you and Charlene annihilate him."
9894	"Cancel my one o'clock. Move my two o'clock to one o'clock and cancel that. Oh, and go to my joke file, and make all the ""Sophia Lorens"" into ""Lindsay Lohans""."
9895	"I overslept, lost my cell phone, missed my flight."
9896	"Mr. Burns may have mastered 2,799 of my 2,800 duties. But I'll wager dollars to donuts he still can't handle a call from his mother."
9897	"It's the Rapture! Quick, get Bart out of the house before God comes!"
9898	But the grocery store sells sugar for thirty-five cents a pound.
9899	As a matter... Homer...
9900	But where do you put something that big?
9901	"Homeland Noodles with Uncle Sam balls? Apu, aren't you going a bit overboard with the patriotism?"
9902	Who knocked down the pins?
9903	"Okay. Uh, this is your second cousin Stanley."
9904	"Gimme a hundred Lotto tickets, Apu. Because Mr. X is on a roll."
9905	Should've chopped off Bart's head long ago.
9906	Somebody's gotta stop them!
9907	"Hmm, the boy's acting really weird. I did everything that TV show told me to and he's still not happy."
9908	Sure there are downsides. But a relationship can't be all hand-holding and restaurant desserts.
9909	Don't lie to me. Are you having an affair with this woman?
9910	"I love that dog, but that is one long, stupid name."
9911	I'm cuckoo for killing stuff!
9912	"Ooh, what a horrible thing to say to a mother."
9913	What a great job. And I could use a job right now.
9914	Only a true father would lead his son to believe he belonged to someone else.
9915	I love that little shill. Let's get her that diary.
9916	We've gotta tell Dad! Where is he?
9917	"Well, well, well, if it isn't Punch N' Juvie."
9918	Yes. 'Cause every time you wear it you'll know how much we love you. Like the one pair of blue pants I bought Homer twenty years ago.
9919	"Outta the way! Move it or lose it! Get going, you!"
9920	"What is your deal, anyway?"
9921	"I'm not greasing the wheels, Dad. I like my teacher."
9922	"Yes, that is an important story. But so is this!"
9923	That's it! Twenty-three skidoo... Twenty-four! Twenty-five skidoo!
9924	All right! My bumper fell off!
9925	"Well, he's not gonna be intimidated anymore. We're gonna toughen him up -- give him a new badass attitude. All those other horses will be shaking in their horse dealies."
9926	"Kids, remember when I promised to feed us from that victory garden? Well, instead I grew this tree!"
9927	I'm gonna sleep on the couch.
9928	"Cousin Kathy invited us so our feelings wouldn't be hurt, and we're going so her feelings won't be hurt."
9929	Meet your new piano mover.
9930	You people took advantage of trusting schoolchildren!
9931	"That's not the idea at all. Okay, well this story isn't ideal, I've never told it to you before."
9932	"Okily-dokily, here's some French roast, now I'll go make toast."
9933	So they need to explore new ways to express their love.
9934	You could fix up the old Storytime Village. They've been out of business ever since that kid got his head cut off.
9935	It's no use. We've got to make an emergency landing.
9936	Now wait a minute. How can you people turn on snakes after all they've done for you?
9937	That's Mary Had a Little Lamb.
9938	"Dear Lord, you've got the wind I need, I've got the prayers you crave. Let's make a deal."
9939	"Oh Bart, I think we're lost."
9940	"Ruthie, kick me away from this nightmare."
9941	"Oh my God, why would I wanna wipe out my memory? What horrible thing did I do?"
9942	"Give it a try. It's like kissing a peanut. Heh, heh, heh."
9943	I'm saving my yelling for where it does some good. Lisa! You're a wonderful child! Keep up the good work!
9944	"Okay, stay frosty! All we need to do is find some sap to pretend to be the writer of our book. So hit the floor and find some pathetic wanna-be author!"
9945	"Well, this sounds like bad news."
9946	"Come on, Maggie, let's try and find the enormous pendulum."
9947	"My purse is made of hemp -- if we burn it, the ""silly smoke"" will mellow out those guards!"
9948	Not to mention hilarious.
9949	That's alright. I think I'll just hit the hay.
9950	"No, no. You want to make American kids work?"
9951	"It's okay, son. You'll do better next time."
9952	"I had but one item left on the list... ""A picture of myself with a smiling child."" What could be easier?"
9953	"I still keep in touch with all those men and some of the sharks. Why, here's us in Hawaii last year. Good times."
9954	Where's Grampa? Wasn't he invited?
9955	"But he is buried here, right?"
9956	I thought it was twenty.
9957	"Now, I insist you take off your shoes when you get inside. And uh, while you're in there, grab as much cancer as you can."
9958	"Here you go, son. Shell casings."
9959	"Oh my God. If Bart could eat the burger and survive, then maybe he can yield the key to an anti-muncher vaccine!"
9960	"Hey, I was trying to help him. At worst, I'm an accomplice. I'm an accomplice!"
9961	Charlie Chaplin?! They sure put you to work.
9962	"Hurry up, Bart, or you'll be late to be killed by the dog."
9963	Don't go telling your buddies at work about this.
9964	But the biggest heart I know is in my sister Lisa.
9965	"Well, there's my X-ray vision, my fire breath... and I can get big laughs with tennis balls."
9966	"Homer. It's not the end of the world. You know, before we got married we hardly ever watched television."
9967	"Oh yeah, right. Just let me go to my car."
9968	I'm gonna need help with this.
9969	"Okay, okay. If a mosquito bites you, does it become a vampire too?"
9970	All right! Trash cookies!
9971	"And nobody's gonna take it away from me! You never had faith in me before. But let me tell you, the slim, lazy Homer you knew is dead. Now I'm a big fat dynamo. And where's that cake?"
9972	"Don't worry, I know it's tonight."
9973	I say we do not categorically ban genetically modified organisms.
9974	"Ahhh, that is so much better than hospital beer."
9975	Putting away groceries -- it's like unwrapping presents from yourself. Fruit roll-ups for Bart... beer roll-ups for Homer...
9976	You don't mean you're going to take on your old bosses?
9977	"Oh Mom, I'm so happy! I never want to let you go!"
9978	Are you planning to hit Ned Flanders with that pipe and take his tickets?
9979	"Mom, what are you doing in my game?! How would you like it if I suddenly started going shopping with you?"
9980	That's it! That's it! I can't take another minute of these stupid screens! Go-- go find some concerned citizens to pick up the slack.
9981	You're sneakin' out to fight that bear. I wanna go too.
9982	"So I thought to myself, what would God do in this situation?"
9983	"Huh, uh. Well, it sounds interesting."
9984	"Dad, come back! I can't walk home with all this stuff!"
9985	That old man over there isn't even making a transaction. He just wants someone to talk to!
9986	"Marge, please. You're embarrassing me in front of the mob."
9987	"If there's anything more exquisite than Queen Anne's lace, I haven't found it."
9988	"Whoa, whoa, whoa. Slow down, Egghead!"
9989	"Thank you. And let me say I missed your sweet, sweet voices."
9990	"Yeah, I wanted to spend Christmas with you guys."
9991	"Marge, if you don't mind, I'm a little busy right now achieving financial independence."
9992	We have our own suggestions for the new nanny. Would you like to hear them?
9993	"I begged him to stop, but he said it was for the good of the nation."
9994	"Uh, can't. I've got to go distract bulls at a rodeo."
9995	"Hmmm, sure. Oh, dear. I can't. I've got three protest rallies tomorrow."
9996	I flew it at an altitude of six feet for a distance of four-and-a-half feet. Then we discovered rain makes it catch fire. Then the FÃ¼hrer fired me.
9997	Hey! Why should she have a better husband than you do?
9998	"Ah food. Good thinking, son."
9999	"No, the voters will decide that in November. I was talking about this."
10000	I can't believe you talked me into this.
10001	"Look, now my son needs your help."
10002	"Homer, you've got it set on ""Whore."""
10003	"Well, if Alec is out, I'm out too. You're on your own, Potsie."
10004	"Bart, don't use language like that!"
10005	"Hey, just because I don't care doesn't mean I don't understand."
10006	Luxury? This thermostat is just painted on.
10007	"All right, Bob. You help us catch the guy trying to kill Homer, we'll make it worth your while."
10008	Go ahead! I ain't afraid of no prison!
10009	"Hey, Barney, look. It was on my list, along with a lot of other things I didn't get to do today. Hey, my boss!"
10010	"My Satan sense is tingling! Into the root cellar, boys!"
10011	I'll just take them right back to the store and-- Whoa.
10012	"Don't worry, Bart, they won't bother you anymore."
10013	Sharing is a bunch of bull too. And helping others. And what's all this crap I've been hearing about tolerance?
10014	"Bart, did you hear that?"
10015	Hmm... what should I write about?
10016	"Annie, would you ever consider taking Krusty back as a client?"
10017	Really? With butterscotch on it?
10018	Shouldn't we be talking about the hundred and fifty million dollar offer?
10019	BARTDOYOUWANTSOMEBROWNIESBEFORE YOUGOTOBED?!
10020	But aren't there side effects?
10021	Uh... the second one. Zilliphone. Next question.
10022	Which way should we go?
10023	"Ah, just snowflakes on my mustache."
10024	She got too clingy. Milhouse doesn't do clingy.
10025	"All right, let's see what the old girl can do."
10026	I've changed my mind! Can you please open the gate?
10027	"We're not rivals. We're just a couple of dreamers who set the bar a little too high. I can't destroy your work, my friend."
10028	"People of Springfield, please be cool like Lou."
10029	More angry texts from work!
10030	Lousy surface dwellers...
10031	"Sorry, ma'am. We don't negotiate with elephants. Ready..."
10032	This would've been a perfect time for it to start raining. Oh what the hell -- I'm telling this story!
10033	"But Dad, it defeats the purpose if you're powering our windmill with the electricity from Flanders."
10034	"Also, the passion play isn't stupid, it's the greatest story ever told!"
10035	No! Don't hurt them! I'll just keep them as pets.
10036	"Oh God, man! Here, drink this paint thinner."
10037	"Oh yeah, I've seen that one."
10038	Oh my God! The legends are true!
10039	"Oh, Bart, my baby boy. Welcome home."
10040	"You're going to the dentist too, Dad."
10041	Hey! Where are you goin'? I'm your pal! I took you for a walk once!
10042	"Uh, honey, there's a point in every father's life when he blows up his daughter's room."
10043	"Bart, can I ask you an important question?"
10044	Community service? But... that's work! What about jail?
10045	"See, Marge? Our lives are so much better now!"
10046	"Be nice to your brother, Lisa."
10047	"No, I'm not. No, I'm not. I'm, uh, dusting for prints."
10048	I would have taken a bribe!
10049	"In honor of legalized gambling, why not go as the state of Nevada?"
10050	Look at this garden of F's. You planted them all!
10051	"We show girls love on Valentine's Day, and they let us blow stuff up on the Fourth of July. I just pray they never fall on the same day."
10052	At last! I'll earn money for schlepping!
10053	"See, I told you Krusty would come. Just like I said, heh, heh. He's gonna bring us food and water and smite our enemies."
10054	Hope I don't give you heartburn!
10055	"I'd rather have a ""Flaming Homer""."
10056	"Hey, check it out! I'm surfing the net!"
10057	"C'mon, Marge, it's primary fever -- catch it!"
10058	Can you follow everything okay?
10059	"Oh, the glue will slow me down."
10060	Don't you two have a list of chores to do?
10061	Oh boy! Barty's gonna party!
10062	Get a load of that quote unquote Santa.
10063	That I'm not a kid anymore.
10064	"Okay, that's two... ...and that's it. If I think of another one, I'll let him back in."
10065	"Dad says this new guy is a repulsive, obnoxious old billionaire, so let's all be extra-nice to him."
10066	House of Pain. This must be where you pay the bill. Why am I always so funny when no one's around?
10067	"I'd like to nominate my teacher, Mrs. Krabappel. She may not be glamorous or entertaining... She's just a real teacher who comes in every day no matter what. And she never gave up on me, Bart Simpson."
10068	Why do you always wait till the last minute to put up the lights?
10069	"And the Lord said, ""Let there be crap."""
10070	I locked him in the torah room.
10071	"The dog's on board, too."
10072	"Screw that, it's Krusty time."
10073	"...and anyone can put a band aid on, but my Dad knows how to take it off so it doesn't hurt."
10074	"Oh, Bea, I'm not cut out for the high life."
10075	Ahhh! Kill it! Kill it!
10076	"Dad, our baby pictures were in there!"
10077	They always come up with such catchy ways to make us pay for things we don't need for kids we didn't want.
10078	"Aw, nuts. Isn't there anybody who can round up these thunder lizards?"
10079	"Well, that was a pretty good party. Do you think Carol from payroll and Mike from shipping are going to hook up?"
10080	"I'm so glad you're watchin' the boys, Marge. Our last babysitter let 'em watch ""Comedy Central"", now Rod makes me check the closet every night for Rita Rudner."
10081	"You talk the talk, Quimby. But do you walk the walk?"
10082	"I've got two things for you: this envelope will change your life for the low, low price of five dollars, and I'll throw in a piece of great advice. Tempted?"
10083	"Hey, keep your hands off my china hutch."
10084	It's an ancient Indian burial ground.
10085	I'm not Mr. Simpson. That ship has sailed. I'm Colonel Cool! And I'm the Captain on this rocket to the stars.
10086	"That's right... gather the nectar, my little drones, and make the honey. Honey for your children."
10087	"Miss Midler, I can't believe you do this all by yourself."
10088	"Of all the people for Marge to cheat on, why did it have to be me?"
10089	You had your hot dog plumped?
10090	"Your potato? You can't like own a potato, man. It's one of Mother Earth's creatures."
10091	"Get with the program, Marge. Your husband is now an ambulance driver!"
10092	And I wouldn't blame him. You destroyed our son's self-esteem.
10093	"Any new tattoos, Otto?"
10094	"Blood, bile, spinal fluid, blood, other, phlegm, miscellaneous ooze..."
10095	You get to see what they do during commercial breaks.
10096	"Why don't you just eat him, Dad."
10097	"Hey, I never chose a path. And because I kept my options open, I can finally do what I want."
10098	"Huh. You hear that world?! They love my ideas, just not me! And that is half the battle! Ha!"
10099	Mom said we could watch it!
10100	"When they show up for their ""free motorboats,"" we arrest them and beat them to the full extent of the law."
10101	And then I learned the true meaning of winter.
10102	It sounded like you were.
10103	"Can I just ask, who the hell says potato?"
10104	It's amazing how much exercise I've gotten from those words.
10105	"Well... my Dad said don't bring home anymore dogs, cats, turtles or snakes, but he never said anything about predatory birds."
10106	"Bart, no dinner means no dessert."
10107	#NAME?
10108	"Ned, I've learned that the only way a relationship survives is by forgiving! Endless, endless forgiving!"
10109	"Hello, I'm Dr. Cheeks. I'm doing my rounds and uh, I'm a little behind."
10110	"Well, like we say, the right house for the right person!"
10111	What's that building over there?
10112	Ice-cream-man-Ice cream-man!
10113	"Hey lady, you gotta pay to use my likeness. It's a registered trademark!"
10114	Are you crying... glitter?
10115	"So, what's the problem, son?"
10116	I guess I'll be getting some extra credit for this.
10117	"Woo hoo! Look, Marge! A couple of bucks!"
10118	Someone's playing my tune!
10119	"Hey, that time she looked right at me and didn't touch me."
10120	"I still get a piece, right?"
10121	"Oh, oh, I just have one question: what is this movie about?"
10122	"You know, Bart, my imaginary friend never made me do things I thought were wrong."
10123	Lisa got a sister! Why can't you have another boy?
10124	"Shut up! It all began when Jebediah Springfield first came to these lands with his partner, Shelbyville Manhattan..."
10125	"Ahh, cancel the APB. But bring back some of them gyros ."
10126	I LIVE ME IN A MANSION / FULL OF THOSE GRECIAN URNS / BUT I'M LONELY ALL THE LIVE-LONG DAY / THAT'S THE BLUES OF MONTY BURNS
10127	Why don't you wear a tie that goes with my eyes?
10128	"Oh, that. I stuck a couple of extra legs on there 'cause I kept tipping over when I was trying to invent stuff."
10129	This could be our new living room painting!
10130	"Oh, I'm sorry, Homie."
10131	"Believe me, he doesn't. His act is getting old fast."
10132	"I don't care if they think you're a coward, Dad. You did the right thing, hiding and crying."
10133	Why aren't you at your new job?
10134	"Well, Lisa, I finished my resume."
10135	"Oh, so, forming an angry mob, eh? Who we goin' after?"
10136	"Hey, Marge. Partaking of the grape, were we?"
10137	"When you're gettin' juiced, can you hold my turtle? I wanna bring him back to life."
10138	"So, a graduate student, huh? How come you guys can go to the moon but you can't make my shoes smell good?"
10139	Barney! You're gonna pull her arm off.
10140	Can I please be alone?
10141	You think you're so great just because you have God-like powers.
10142	We don't even get this many Christmas cards.
10143	"Well, I'll be. The Itchy and Scratchy Movie."
10144	"Let's just say one of the ladies had some ""extra equipment."""
10145	What? He didn't fold? But that's insane unless he has...
10146	"Oh, really? Then play some rock music."
10147	Are any of those my size? Extra extra extra extra extra extra extra large.
10148	Bowling ball... more underpants...
10149	Wow! It's a machine that makes carnival food at home.
10150	"With that painting we could have what these people have. A money cushion. No more living paycheck to paycheck, one lost retainer away from the gutter."
10151	"You know, we've been through some two hundred and eighty adventures together, but our bond has never been stronger."
10152	Nah. I might land on my face and end up lookin' like you.
10153	I can't stand to see one of my female children unhappy. I'm gonna go pound some sense into that ring-linking rabbit-yanker!
10154	"Don't worry, he'll be here."
10155	"Ah, run along, Quimby. I think they're dedicating a phone booth somewhere."
10156	Up bup bup bup bup! What have we learned about not blindly supporting our husband?
10157	"Yes, but I didn't do it."
10158	"Mom, I didn't eat any of it. I'm not stupid."
10159	We're all gonna sit down as a family and listen to an inspiring story of wilderness survival.
10160	"Ooh, that's the heart of the bit!"
10161	No one's shotgun! Now be quiet!
10162	Where'd you find these?
10163	Okay. It's now painfully clear. The adults are definitely paving the way for an invasion by the saucer people.
10164	"Oh, my, what a little mess we've got here! Well, which ones are yours and which ones are mine?"
10165	"Oh Mom, this guest list sucks."
10166	"Are you going bowling again tonight, Mom?"
10167	And another thing: no death races!
10168	It's so unfair -- I'm as handy as any man.
10169	"Man oh man, you've got the greatest job in the world!"
10170	They say we're contaminating the planet.
10171	I guess no one gives a damn about the American family anymore.
10172	"All of you! Get back out there with your flippers flapping, and your stumps a-stomping! Joe and Jane normal expect some entertainment for their nickel!"
10173	"Sorry, boy. I didn't plan this. It just sort of happened."
10174	"Thanks, Mother Dexter! I'll be back tomorrow."
10175	Well we'll have to organize a carpool. Every day will be like a road trip!... With your dad!... To school!
10176	"Hey, where's your blue shirt?"
10177	"Here, this may sound just a teensy bit insane in the ol' membrane, Homer. But I, I was wondering if you could show me how to have some fun."
10178	"I guess you're right, Principal Tamzarian."
10179	Extended warranty? How can I lose?
10180	"If I'm gonna tell that woman the truth, I'm gonna do it in the one place no one can ever be sad."
10181	"Dear Bart, I am using the stationery Mom and Dad gave me for my birthday to inform you that we are now brother and sister in name only. Perhaps if a professional so advises, I will give you a hug at some far distant family reunion, but rest assured it will be purely for show."
10182	"hours of entertainment for free. What could they possibly owe you? I mean, if anything, you owe them."
10183	And did you pay for those clothes you're wearing?
10184	"Oh, hey, hey. Family, family, come here. I have an announcement to make. The Simpsons have cable."
10185	"No, Dad, he's my friend!"
10186	How do you know it's from Mad?
10187	"Kids, look! Street crime!"
10188	"It's just a legal thing, to protect me."
10189	"Nope, looks normal... Wait a minute."
10190	An ancient Indian what...?
10191	"Oooh, I'll have that one. And to drink... ... meatballs."
10192	"But you can tell, right? She looks around and sees everybody else's dad with a good education, youthful looks and a clean credit record and thinks, ""Why me? What did I do to deserve this fat old piece of -- """
10193	That's right -- you're all crooks!
10194	I'm talking about the Simpsons.
10195	"Here, Milhouse, you go first."
10196	And you won't... unless you can leap through fire!
10197	"No, as a reminder of the hurtful things men can do."
10198	But our thing was camping.
10199	That guy was a grifter!
10200	"You know sweetie, there was a time when I would've killed for that information, but I'm pleased to announce I've already bought your mother a present."
10201	Thankily-dankily! Greatalicious!
10202	"Now, I know I haven't been the best Jew... but I rented ""Fiddler on the Roof"", and I will watch it. Anyway, can I have forty-thousand dollars?"
10203	Can I have some peanuts?
10204	"Dad, number one: I know how to ride a bike. Number two: I already own a bike. And number three: that is a girl's bike."
10205	"Marge, I'm getting' out of the break-up business and I don't know if I'll ever sleep soundly again."
10206	"After a pulse-pounding race, hypertension pills win again!"
10207	"My hunger strike will not end until Duff admits they're moving the team. Bart, my chains."
10208	Look at that absorbativity! I've gotta tell someone...
10209	"Look, if it were up to me, I'd be harassing them with you. If anything, I'd be the guy who took it too far. But I love my wife and I want to win her back!"
10210	I believe this stranger!
10211	"Uh, gee, I'm afraid that dress is long gone. I threw it out the window during my post-show hissy fit."
10212	"They're outlaws?! I've been played like a pair of spoons! Well, who am I to judge -- it's the Depression, money's tight..."
10213	"The term ""Soccer Mom"" is thrown around all too often these days. But the nominees in our next category..."
10214	"Actually, I'm taking you on a ""special little guy super happy fun"" day!"
10215	"Something very close, exactly along those lines--A Clint Eastwood - Lee Marvin shoot 'em up western!"
10216	That flamboyant fop! He's got them eating out of his hand.
10217	"Well, guess I might as well head back to my store. I've got a date with some twins: my state and federal tax forms."
10218	When did you start liking Thai food?
10219	"We all have to make sacrifices, dear. Maggie's baby clothes will have to last for a little longer..."
10220	"Mom, you cut the tether."
10221	No further questions.
10222	"Well, that thing's been drivin' the whole town nuts! Got me out of the bath seven times. Seven!"
10223	Who's a possum? You're a possum.
10224	Ha! February has no twenty-third!
10225	It's lucky for me that Legs was an experienced mob doctor.
10226	"Relax. This is cinema verite. When the brutal slow-motion killing starts, I'll tell you to shut your eyes."
10227	"The same way Hollywood does, by watching British movies!"
10228	"Can I see your copy of ""Swank"", Armin?"
10229	"That was cold-blooded, Marge."
10230	Is this all he watches?
10231	Lenny Lenford. You're a long way from your barstool.
10232	Our next match is Marge and Bart Simpson...
10233	Maybe it was just the cat.
10234	"Boy, you sure have married a lot of super-hunks."
10235	"Enjoy it now, because when you're a grown up, you'll have to take care of yourself."
10236	"Sweetie, you could still go to McGill -- the Harvard of Canada."
10237	I thought we were just going to ask if he had seen Homer.
10238	Animation is so great. It's way better than... whatever the alternative is.
10239	"Homer, I've never told you this before, but I'm not a good flyer. I have to get off the plane. Let me off the plane. I'm asking you nicely to open the doors."
10240	"You know, I had this very same discussion with your mother ten years ago."
10241	"Oh, I got it -- you want me to stay out here and work on the chorus."
10242	"...but screw them, you're in! Congratulations!"
10243	Can we at least get out of the house for an evening?
10244	"Good for you, son. Giving up smoking is one of the hardest things you'll ever have to do. Have a dollar."
10245	What the? Pfft. Gibberish! Pure gibberish!
10246	"You know Homer, we've all been busy as beavers preparing for our very own show."
10247	"Homie, my sisters are here."
10248	Do you remember when you lost your passion for this work?
10249	There's that word again.
10250	"Wait, these are just guys from school. Who's next? Ralph Wiggum?"
10251	I think this time it'll have a happier ending.
10252	Excellent. So we'll take the boy and make a night of it.
10253	"No, not yet. I was voted the handsomest boy in Albany, New York."
10254	"Whatever they're paid, it's not enough."
10255	Lisa's slumber party.
10256	"Homer, I want that thing out of my house."
10257	Yeah. This is my only refuge from the taunts and accusations of the townspeople.
10258	"What'd you think, kids?"
10259	"Well, howdaly-do, Simpson? Gettin' a little exercise, eh? Good for you, pal. Oh, look at this old rascal! He's a wet old baby boy, isn't he? Isn't he? You're just a water monster."
10260	"Ooh, hello, sweet cheeks."
10261	We did it! We wrote an awesome song!
10262	Whacking Day is coming.
10263	Forever? That would be awesome.
10264	But I did delete him from my bulk email list.
10265	"Mom, you're always trying to give me potatoes. What is it with you?"
10266	I'M A NICE GUY / I'M A HELL OF A GUY / AND TONIGHT WE HONOR YOU... Stop the music. Stop it! One more line and we have to pay for the song.
10267	"Lis, you taught me to stand up for what I believe in."
10268	"Well, we both faced a tough decision...go off to journalism school, or stay in Springfield with our sweethearts?"
10269	Is this cel worth anything?
10270	"That's exactly what I'm saying, Decapitating Harry. Now move it."
10271	"Kids, sometimes when a daddy learns that a mommy always hated him, he needs some time away to think."
10272	"Hey, will you guys sign my yearbook?"
10273	"Really, anyone? What about the Hulk riding a rhinoceros? Would you stop him from laughing?"
10274	"Did Gaga just say ""hurt everyone""?"
10275	"Zounds is a renaissance English word, short for ""God's Wounds."" But uh, ""smite-ly,"" that's pure Flanders!"
10276	Does the whole town have to hear about this?
10277	So many times we've seen our father go under the knife.
10278	Gosh... that was a hard sleeping bag to roll up.
10279	"And it was fine for the 1930's. The country was doing great back then. Everyone was into talking. But now, in whatever year this is, the audience wants action! And seats with beverage holders, but mainly action."
10280	How 'bout Don Johnson?
10281	"No, I-I mean just the Flanders family."
10282	"Shut up, boy. Marge, what do you think?"
10283	Okay. Let's make some fireworks.
10284	"No way. If something happens to me, you have to carry on the Simpson name."
10285	"WHAT I DON'T GET IS, WHY ALL THE LIES?"
10286	"I'm tellin' you, Bart, one vice leads to another. And then you wind up like me: so jaded, the only thing that gets you off is free-basing ground-up moon rocks."
10287	LISA IT'S YOUR BIRTHDAY /
10288	"No, it's entirely within my power. Furthermore, there never were any nuclear inspectors. Check and mate. Now, king me!"
10289	"Hiya, Stretch! What's the good word?"
10290	"Everyone else might give up on me, but my parents never will."
10291	I got one for just watching the game.
10292	"Okay, so Helen Lovejoy told me that she made her famous snicker doodle Bundt cake for the church sale, and she put in salt instead of sugar!"
10293	"Hey, Otto-man. I dare you to make this go faster."
10294	My Malibu Stacy heads!
10295	Okay. It all started Sunday morning...
10296	"No, sir. I was laughing at something outside."
10297	"All the beer from the landfill is gone, Beer Baron. We're out of business."
10298	I can see that down deep is a decent man.
10299	No I'm not. I'm really...
10300	"Homer, it's two in the morning."
10301	"Hey, you know, stopping criminals is fun. And I felt like a big man pushing that kid around."
10302	It's only fair. We went to Europe when Lisa lost her balloon.
10303	Yieg err meth frau-baii-rr-a hoo-g-minn-d.
10304	Now don't you worry. Just sit back and relax to the smooth sounds of Tommy Dorsey's All-White Orchestra.
10305	"Look, this videotape should answer all your questions."
10306	Dad... I couldn't stay with Mom and Lisa while you were out here.
10307	"Geez, you just have to remember three extra numbers."
10308	"Don't come off all high and mighty with me, Patterson. You can't scare me, with your office and your desk and your lamp."
10309	Nothing left! Nothing left!
10310	"Check it out, ladies. The suit that makes me completely invulnerable to bear attack."
10311	Lisa has a dead boyfriend!
10312	Dr. Hibbert? Is someone seriously ill?
10313	"Teeny, get her outta here!"
10314	I built a skating rink for the whole town!
10315	Mr. Burns! The Nuclear Regulatory Commission is here for a surprise inspection!
10316	But you thought they were.
10317	That wasn't part of the deal!
10318	"Lou, we'd better go after him. Eddie, you direct traffic. You're the graceful one."
10319	There's sausage being made? Where?
10320	You're talking to the girl who wants a career in jazz.
10321	"Nobody loves you. Nobody loves you. You're old and you're ugly. Nobody loves you. Yea, yea, yea yea!"
10322	"Oh, yes. Very much so."
10323	"You want your bear, Bobo, don't you?"
10324	"No, Pie Man! Don't do it!"
10325	Oh my God! You don't suppose they're gonna start--
10326	"Places where my intelligence will be an asset, not a liability?"
10327	It's not about spite. It's about petty revenge and getting back at that traitor Moe. Now help me nail up this urinal.
10328	"Well that's great, Homie. Just let me finish uploading this photo."
10329	"But Reverend, I need to know. Is God punishing me?"
10330	This place is amazing! Kiosks! Outdoor study groups!
10331	Do you need a beer to fall asleep?
10332	"Marge, I changed in Boise. I'm not sure a man who eats right and doesn't drink can be good in bed."
10333	"Of course! It's so simple... Wait, no it's not. It's needlessly complicated."
10334	"Yeah -- ""All Quiet On The Western Front!"""
10335	"Thankfully, a mother mole nursed me as her own until I was strong enough to continue."
10336	How could they open another franchise so close to me?
10337	"Just try to enjoy your dinner, sweetie."
10338	"We all need a little time to ourselves, Helen. Just give him a day or two and I'm sure he'll be back to his old dynamic self."
10339	"Sleep tight, my angel!"
10340	"Um, he likes it if you tickle his toes."
10341	"Marge, this is a way to flush this killer out once and for all -- and get drunk on a Tuesday."
10342	Did you spend an unforgettable night with a soldier from the U.S. Army in 1944? You did? Was he from the first infantry division? He was? And was he a gentle caring lover? He was? Sorry I bothered you.
10343	Then let's do this thing!
10344	"That was the first time I ever saw ""Itchy and Scratchy"" and I didn't like it one bit. It was disgusting and violent. I think all you people are despicable. For shame!"
10345	"No, s'okay. We can share this with you... Homer can't make a baby because he nuked his swimmers."
10346	You'll have to raise my allowance to about a thousand dollars a week.
10347	"Marge, you're taking this pretty well."
10348	That's what you get for not hailing to the Chimp.
10349	Disgracefully hilarious! You passed out before we could even give you your presents.
10350	I wouldn't go to jail. The legal owner of this plant would:
10351	"That's right. I love you Marge, and I realize now I should show you more often. The end of your book was the wakeup call I needed after falling asleep at the beginning of your book."
10352	What? That doesn't sound like me.
10353	"Actually, there are four plusses."
10354	Old ad for Buzz Cola...
10355	"Hey, it worked on me."
10356	How the hell did they find that out?
10357	"Uh, he told me he was going to nap most of the week."
10358	"Okay. What I was going to say, was..."
10359	"But kids, I want you in bed by three a.m."
10360	"Marge, what are you doing here?"
10361	I woke up and the money jar was full! That means the devil accepted my bargain. Now to uphold my end of the deal!
10362	You danced for hours just because they told you to?
10363	"Yeah, well I work better in a structured environment."
10364	"Okay, I know what'll cheer you kids up. Seeing me out-monkey the monkeys."
10365	What are you doing here? I told you I'm not your monkey anymore.
10366	I have frozen myself so I may live to see the wonders of the future. Thaw me out when robot wives are cheap and effective. P.S. Please alter my pants as fashion dictates.
10367	A ride on the Duff Blimp...
10368	"Hello class. Hi Bart. Over here, sweetie. It's me, Mom. Hi. Hey. Hello."
10369	Oh he's gone and he's never coming back. Wait! There he is. No... that's a horse.
10370	These are our new boarders!
10371	"Oh, I want trouble all right."
10372	"Oh, yeah. Hope you like PopTarts."
10373	We'll be safe on this Battleboat.
10374	Jackanapes... lolligaggers... noodle heads... enchantress!
10375	They're coming down the aisles! What if they want to interact with me!?
10376	"For God's sake, Homer. Give them back their flame!"
10377	I wish I could hear what they're saying.
10378	Her eyes aren't focused.
10379	"I'm sorry, Maggie. I never realized things between us had gotten this bad."
10380	Fine. As soon as I finish watching my show.
10381	"I made the right decision to stay with my Homie, and there was no harm done. So if you kind of mentally snip out the part where I already had a husband, that's my idea of romance."
10382	"It worked -- I got my sky back! Dad, look!"
10383	"Oh, I hope they don't reveal this is a comb-over."
10384	"I don't need a brother. I'm a badass loner like Wolverine, who leaves whenever people beg him not to leave."
10385	Come on! It's cobblering time!
10386	"You guys are damn lucky. All you destroyed were bricks, mortar and attorneys."
10387	I've gotta close Praiseland down. Someone could get hurt.
10388	"Hmm, dare I pour caramel over the cotton candy?"
10389	Handyman's Choice Copper Tubing?
10390	"For me, that's a perfect day!"
10391	Great! Now we're raccoons -- the masked bandits of the animal world!
10392	"Well done, young man. Your youthful trendiness will come in handy throughout the courting process. Because these days..."
10393	You never know when you might wanna mail something.
10394	"Rod, you order anything you want for your big ten-oh."
10395	"Aren't you ready for church, Homer?"
10396	"Check out Lisa. She's a sax machine! Makes me think I should've done something with my life. Oh, well."
10397	"How's it going, honey?"
10398	"I don't want to hear your whining. I'm a bored and joyless old man, give me a laugh!"
10399	"Hey Dad, why don't we watch you drink from a hose?"
10400	"Son, I know you're upset because you thought you saw us on TV saying we didn't want you in our family. But those were just actors playing us."
10401	Fine. I don't even know why we have a bottle. Somebody tell me!
10402	"There's no need for apologies, guys. You're rock stars! You're supposed to be reckless and destructive, and be celebrated for behavior that would land normal people in jail."
10403	"Oh, Lenny, I'm sure he'll like your wife no matter what she looks like."
10404	"I know this looks bad. And I admit, I would totally lie in a second to Lisa or Mom or Dad. But I would never lie to Maggie."
10405	"Okay, okay. It's your sugar, Bart."
10406	It's so exciting! It's like living in a dictionary.
10407	Does anybody need that much porno?
10408	What the hell are you talking about?!
10409	How come you talked for four hundred dollars?
10410	"Shut up, boy. Cheap Chinese TVs... Why did I every buy... Is that better?"
10411	"Sorry, Homie, but you promised to take me to the Apron Expo today."
10412	"Oh, who am I kidding? It's all my fault."
10413	"Well, I know what I'm gettin': some donuts. Uh, help me outta the booth, boys."
10414	Keep on truckin'? What does that mean?
10415	That still sounds like the smart kid.
10416	Stop that! I'm down here!
10417	"Well, I do have a life outside this house, you know."
10418	Albuquerque Balloon Festival? Rush Limbaugh's sweatpants?
10419	"Oh, I was having the most wonderful dream. I had a hat, and a tie with no pants on."
10420	We've got to get closer!
10421	So move on! You're blocking the ducks!
10422	I said foul on twenty-three!
10423	Yeah. Or is it just a cover story for a grownup thing we're not allowed to know about?
10424	"Marge, when I started prepping for the end of the world, everyone laughed at me."
10425	How about if I triple the business? Then could I get a raise?
10426	"We should start our own food blog... ""The Three Mouthketeers!"""
10427	"I can still see your movies, right?"
10428	"Oh Honey, I know it's not easy, but we've got to put money away."
10429	We come now to the final and most terrifying painting of the evening. To even gaze upon it is to go mad.
10430	"Ah... great toast, Marge. Hmmm. Oh, by the way, the night before the election Mr. Burns is coming over for dinner."
10431	I'm the what? I thought I was this guy. Ohhh.
10432	"Oh, who are you, the health inspector?"
10433	"Well, if God didn't make little green apples -- it's Homer Simpson! How long have you been here?"
10434	Our top criminologists have a theory as to what the suspect just might look like.
10435	AND ONE WHO WILL WORK FOR MINIMUM WAGE--
10436	"And while on Ventnor Avenue you'll be staying at the fabulous Hotel Lisa. A valet will be around shortly to park your thimble. Of course, there is the unpleasant matter of the bill."
10437	"Of course. Gosh, Dad, your hands are shaking!"
10438	"Yeah, that pressure we put on her really paid off!"
10439	"Hey, I'm the Chief here. Bake him away, toys."
10440	What exactly did he say?
10441	"Oh, boo hoo. After all the times I've done it, my wrist sounds like a cement mixer."
10442	"I've had enough of your stinkin' thinkin'. I, Homer Simpson, will personally bring the new pro football franchise to Springfield."
10443	"Marge, I believe you're forgetting America's greatest wartime wheelchair-bound leader: Professor X of the X-Men."
10444	"I, myself, played in this ballpark, back in nineteen forty-deuce. That was during the war, when sushi was called ""liberty logs,"" and no one had ever heard of it."
10445	"Huh? Huh? Listen, what if I helped you turn this bar into a hangout for guys like me?"
10446	"Dad, if you take me to Vegas, I'll teach you how to cheat at blackjack."
10447	"Are you a terrorist? No. ""Would you like to meet someone special but are tired of the bar scene?"" No. I will never tire of the bar scene!"
10448	Really? You think it's dangerous?
10449	"What do you mean, how did I get on the radio? I created the universe! Stupid kids."
10450	"Here's the score, Mister:"
10451	"Really, that's oka-- Aaaggh!"
10452	"Hey Mom, can we have fried chicken for dinner?"
10453	"Buddy, buddy. Think of it this way: you're not singing in front of all those people, you're alone at the Kwik-E-Mart in the middle of the night. You just wear this on stage, and everything will be fine."
10454	"If they can be that rude, the food must be great!"
10455	Homer Simpson has become a snitch.
10456	"Today's book is ""Bridget Jones' Diary."" Now, let's go around the room and analyze why we didn't read it."
10457	The hurricane's over.
10458	"Yeah, what do you want?"
10459	"Hello, Reverend Lovejoy."
10460	"Okay, you leave me no option."
10461	"You're not licked, Krusty. People love a comeback. Look at Robert Downey Junior... Mickey Rourke..."
10462	I propose to you that your heir need not be a boy. In this phallocentric society of ours...
10463	Well... maybe we can find something.
10464	"Hello, Helen? I'm calling about the recent destruction of our town. Well, I have a little plan to fix their wagon."
10465	That came from Flanders' house.
10466	"Oh my God, I forgot to get Marge a present!"
10467	"I'm sorry, I believe in good grooming."
10468	"Lisa, you're not buying more than your weight in books."
10469	Damn buzzards! I ain't dead yet.
10470	Krusty! Oh thanks! Thanks a lot! You came here to save me!
10471	"Dear Lord, bless this humble meal, and did you hear about Krusty? Whoa, man! I mean, I knew he was a player, but geez, a kid?"
10472	I'll miss you kids too.
10473	He must be a hundred feet tall.
10474	"When you're older, you'll miss these fun activities."
10475	"Wait, Dad, he's smiling."
10476	You don't scare me with your dignity and your subtle cologne.
10477	"Yup, he'll be all alone on his birthday! Oh, I wish I could see it. Boo hoo! I'm Nelson. No one likes me."
10478	Do I dare to go up? Or is the love that waits behind that window just a lie?
10479	Parenting. It's the one job you always know you're doing right.
10480	This is horrible. People will start to avoid Springfield.
10481	My husband has our card...
10482	"Sensual, isn't it? And the best part is Stupid Flanders doesn't even know it's happening in his stupid house. Hence my nickname, Stupid Flanders."
10483	Hey. These don't work.
10484	"All right, you can shoot your gay adult film at my house."
10485	"Yes, but if I do something will you look the other way?"
10486	"Well, I think we better set an example."
10487	"Oh, what a gyp. They're all just lying around. Do something!"
10488	"Oh no! King Toot's is closed! Dad, you're gonna have to take me to the... big box music store."
10489	Please please please please please...
10490	I'd like to go home now. And to think you'd do this on Mother's Day.
10491	It can't just be sex. It can't.
10492	"That's it, D. Don't let anyone push you around. Be as bad as you wanna be."
10493	"How long till it's up and running, sir?"
10494	I'd like that. I'd like it a lot.
10495	"Help, I'm being kidnapped!"
10496	Children of the playground! I will eat anything for money! Except money!
10497	"While Johnny Welfare plays acid rock on a stolen guitar, his old lady has a better idea."
10498	I threw that away because studies show it doesn't do any good!
10499	Which goes great with another male invention -- the car.
10500	No one sent me. I just knocked on the door and it opened!
10501	Liberace action figure.
10502	"Hey, where'd you go?... Little man?"
10503	Look at us. We're starin' at each other like a couple of stupid punk teenagers.
10504	And all the Transformers transformed back into trucks and cars. The end.
10505	"That's great, honey. If you were a boy, you'd be a scientist."
10506	A dime? What do you think I am -- a pay phone from nineteen eighty?!
10507	Three more big ones and we'll talk.
10508	"Don't let Krusty's death get you down, boy. People die all the time. Just like that. Why, you could wake up dead tomorrow. Well, good night."
10509	"Why should we have to give up our salty snacks, just to keep one allergic kid from exploding?! Who is this selfish jerk anyway?"
10510	Don't talk. Listen. The social order of elementary school is densely layered. The coolest kids are at the top.
10511	That don't mean nothin'! Dogs wag their tails for hours after they die. I'm tired of this conversation. Let's talk about something else. I'm going home.
10512	"Did you eat the cookies, Maggie."
10513	"Tell him yourself. You're ignoring Lisa, not Bart."
10514	"Gee Lisa, looks like tomorrow I'll be shoveling ten feet of ""global warming."""
10515	"Mrs. Krabappel, I didn't unlock that door."
10516	How dare you question Mr. Burns?
10517	What were their names?
10518	"Dad, no! That takes us into a construction site!"
10519	"Hurry up! We got a lotta tonic to sell and a lotta towns to visit: Frigid Falls, Mount Seldom, Lake Flaccid..."
10520	No. But you're close.
10521	"Huh? Oh, right. The steak."
10522	"Gentlemen, the game is capture the flag. Rod, ladies pick first."
10523	"It's okay Dad, I can fill in for Nelson."
10524	"So many categories... Gym teacher of the year, Substitute teacher of the year, Most Wheelchair-Accessible School Award?"
